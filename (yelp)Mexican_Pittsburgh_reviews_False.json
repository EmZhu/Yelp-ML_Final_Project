The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\n\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.

If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.\n\nBeing regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.\n\nThe burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  \n\nThe food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:\n1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.\n2. As off-season tomatoes tend to be finiky, sometimes the pico is fresh and flavorful, sometimes you get the gritty or cardboard-ish tomatoes.\n3. Some of there servers are great while other times you get one that leaves you wanting more from the service.\n\nIn contrast to another review, YES, they do appreciate you on your birthday.  None of that childish singing or a flamboyant dessert... if you are on there list, you get a birthday card for a free burrito.  That's better than any of that cheesy crap.

So delicious and it all came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.\n\nI love reading their menu. The Mex-Asian dishes all sound awesome.

The kitchen had my meal ready super quickly as well and I was out the door in under a hour. Pretty darn impressive considering just how busy they were that night.\n\nSince then Mad Mex hasn't disappointed.

Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice.", "user_id": "oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 3}

Other then the occasional hot dog vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.\n\nI've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.\n\n\nThe Chicken Taco:\n\nKandace might be right. This was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. They were obviously homemade and perfectly cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty thin which worried me at first because the chance of it being dry was greatly increased. I couldn't have been more wrong. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. Each taco was topped with a good amount of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice touch). They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. I'm glad I did. I could easily eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.\n\nThe Steak Taco:\n\nBasically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty chewy. It wasn't as perfect as the chicken but it was pretty close.\n\nThe Rating:\n\nWas it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos\n\nDid I feel gross afterwards?: Not really\n\nWould I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco\n\nWould I order it again?: The chicken yes.

{"text": "Where to begin, where to begin...\n\nMore often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing.

I'm still hoping for them to get Goya or other ones (that wont come to mind at the moment). \nThey also have many argentinean brands of Dulce de Leche (I don't care if this one is pricey because as fattening as that is, and as tempted as I can get with one pot, I don't mind not being able to get it). And Yerba Mate, all of the brand from Argentina and Paraguay, and they also have them in flavors.\n\nUPDATE (Dec. 2013): Reyna food has replaced Edgar's tacos stand and Edgar's tacos has been moved around the corner, closer to Pamela's on 21st Street.

The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles...

I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet.

{"text": "Let me now tell you the story of Taco Bell on Noblestown Road, kids.\n\nFirst off, it's Taco Bell, so it can't get anything higher than three stars if we're being honest. The last time Taco Bell wowed me was probably before there was a Taco Bell in most every town. When I was a kid and we went to visit my grandparents in Florida, they had one down there and it was a real treat to go. This was back in the '70s, mind you.\n\nSo that being said, I miss classic menu items like the Bell Beefer, the Taco Light, and the CInnamon Crispas. Taco Bell, don't you know you have plenty of middle-aged fans out here who would gladly plunk down petty cash just to have these retro delights once again? Isn't nostalgia all the rage these days? For every breakfast waffle and quesarito you guys have spent months on in test kitchens, you could easily just bring back some old faves.\n\nBut I digress. This particular Taco Bell is so hit and miss on service it would be laughable were it not so sad. The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru there, it literally took the car in front of my 15 minutes each time to get its order and drive away. Who knows why it happened the first time. The second time, however, it all came down to a bunch of goofballs working the kitchen,\n\nYou see, I had ordered the new quesarito Big Box as well as another combo meal on the menu and a couple apple empanadas. I noticed that before the guy at the window gave me my food, he double, nay, triple checked the order before handing it to me. So He hands me my bag o' food and I head out only to discover that - surprise -  the main component of the quesarito big box was missing.\n\nI shook my fist and cursed the night air as I turned around and headed back. I went inside with my receipt. A guy who wasn't cooking and wasn't working the window came up and I told him what my problem was. He apologized and told the cooks that he needed a beef quesarito (man I'm already sick of typing that word). A little time passes, and then the cooks both ask what kind of quesarito to make...and then they do it again about ten seconds after that.\n\nIn the meantime, the drive-through guy is checking other orders. He finds something wrong with one of them and tells the cooks. They bicker with him and insist they got the order right. Some more bickering ensues and the cooks then agree that the order was wrong. Some more time passes.\n\nThey get that order done and then ask once again what kind of quesarito I wanted.\n\nBeef. Always beef. It hasn't changed since you asked twice five minutes ago. Guh.\n\nSo I finally get the quesarito and head home. I have no idea what's going on there with that particular crew, but suffice it to say that more training couldn't hurt. There's definitely a communication breakdown (it's always the same) going on there. \n\nMay I never type \"quesarito\" again.", "user_id": "5yC_sdGnYfXTX7Djp_4SVQ", "business_id": "vTnvE0fsPP4r1Eni7gufrQ", "stars": 2}

Well, I was mostly right, but it turns out that Qdoba is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! In fact, I could easily see it becoming a fantastic occasional treat in my life.\n\nI stopped in and ordered a quesadilla to go and couldn't have been happier. The pulled pork was delicious and I was able to get extra salsa, guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side, meaning that my main entree wasn't completely slathered in distracting toppings. And I was SO impressed with the staff and assembly line they had going. Despite coming in to find a long dinner line, I was in and out within minutes. Very nice!\n\nI didn't stay to eat here because the layout in the dining area seemed pretty cramped, although I noticed as I was getting ready to leave that there was an upstairs. Any place in Oakland is bound to have space issues sometimes just because of the student lunch/dinner rush. But the layout here did nothing to help the matter; while the staff were able to keep the line moving, there was almost no room to actually accommodate the long line that began forming and snaking through the tiny building. \n\nStill, the food was pretty excellent, even if I had to go elsewhere to get some elbow room while I devoured it. For the record, comparing Qdoba and Chipotle seems pretty apples and oranges given that their menus are only a little similar. So sure, the food is better at Chipotle, but the options aren't NEARLY as diverse. Apples and oranges. A better comparison is Qdoba and Taco Bell, and in that sense Qdoba is truly superior. I mean really, who thinks it's even a contest?\n\nUnfortunately there were no reasonably healthy options here, so I doubt I'm going to be able to become a regular.

Here's what I have to say about Qdoba. First off, their burrito is equally as fat as Chipotle's. Qdoba's chicken was a bit dry and the seasoning not as flavorful. The beans too soggy, making the whole burrito extremely soggy. The salsa was not crisp, but mushy. Overall, I thought the burrito was kind of bland due to the lacking of seasoning in the chicken. \n\nThe final verdict: I did not finish my buritto.

{"text": "I received a catered meal from here on Mon. night at a talk that I attended.  It contained a chicken burrito, a few chips and pico de gallo, and half a brownie.  While edible, the chicken burrito was nothing special--it contained mostly rice, plus some chicken and the standard black beans.  There were very few veggies, and no extras, included in the burritos.  While I understand that not everyone may want guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. in their burritos, it would be nice to offer a small portion of these as an accompaniment either in each meal, or a larger portion of them with the order for people to apply as they please.  I found the lack of extras especially ironic in light of Qdoba's recent ad campaign about extras not costing extra.\n\nBased on past experience, I believe the quality of this meal is representative of the quality of product at this Qdoba.  I visited with my labmates for lunch a little over a year ago, and recall being similarly underwhelmed by the nachos and quesadilla, both of which are two of my favorite Americanized Mexican foods.  Way back in 2007, when I tried Chipotle and Qdoba for the first time in Fort Collins, CO, I recall preferring Qdoba, because I felt that the product was similar in quality, but I appreciated the greater choice that Qdoba offered (I'm more into nachos and quesadillas than burritos, TBH).  However, based on more recent experience, I feel that the product quality at Qdoba (at least, at this location) has declined.  If they want to remain competitive with the similar business across the street, they need to kick up the product quality a notch.

Mad Mex serves up super Americanized Tex-Mex and they don't pretend to be authentic by any means.  They have burritos, tacos, nachos, salads, wings, you name it.  For me, I go solely for their wings.  A large order of 14 wings ($4.50 when half off) is more than sufficient, and pair that with a $7 BIG AZZ margarita and everything is good.  Flavor of choice?  San Francisco.  All their flavors are good and their wings are some of the better wings I've had in Pittsburgh in terms of how well they're cooked.\n\nIf I'm not getting wings, what would I get?  Wing-o-rito.  It's a burrito w/ chicken inside that's smothered in wing sauce.  Okay, I really like their wings.\n\nTry their double dipper with black bean dip too!  It's super hearty, slightly spicy, and pairs perfectly with a margarita.\n\nIf you go at night, it gets LOUD.

{"text": "With a Big Burrito gift card in tow (yay Christmas presents!), we headed over to Mad Mex on a Friday evening, around 6:30 pm.  Parking was pretty bad for Pittsburgh - we've never been to this part of Oakland before and it was just tiny, crowded streets, and students smoking on their porches while discussing drunken escapades.  Not the nicest neighborhood.\n\nInside, it was packed.  We anticipated a long wait, but actually were seated immediately - the noisy crowd wasn't there for dinner, just happy hour and cheap margaritas.  Apparently you get a table only if you are really eating a meal, which I have to say I appreciated.  The room was dark and noisy, but the noise level become much more manageable as happy hour ended and the drunk students left.  Much improved.\n\nOur server informed us there were only a few minutes left of happy hour, so we managed to squeeze in a quick order of margaritas in order to get the discounted price.  $5 for their medium size (happy hour only) was a pretty good deal.  I had whatever their featured margarita was - frozen, with three different fruit flavors.  It was very tasty, gave me a light buzz, and didn't taste of mix.  Would've appreciated more than a \"light buzz,\" if you know what I mean, but for $5 it was a deal.\n\nWe ordered chips and salsa, which are unfortunately not free as they usually are at Mexican restaurants, but you did get a few fun salsa choices - we settled on roasted tomato chipotle.  I think it cost $3.  I liked the smoky chipotle flavor - but I still think it ought to be free.  It always seems greedy to me when restaurants charge for things that are traditionally free, like bread, or chips/salsa.  \n\nFor my entree, I got one of the specials, which the server said was a great choice - the Jerk Pork and Fried Banana Tacos.  I have to admit, they were pretty tasty.  Pork was well-seasoned, bananas were delish (but I would've liked more of them!), but HOLY CRAP those tacos were hot.  And I love spicy food, truly spicy food.  But this - there were these whole slices of hot peppers.  I bit into one once, and couldn't taste anything for 10 minutes, it felt like my mouth was shaking.  Spicy tacos are one thing, but so hot that you can't even enjoy the meal?  I had to pick the peppers out, for my poor tongue's sake.  Rice and beans on the side were bland, which would have been annoying but ended up not bothering me given my temporary taco-mouth-death.\n\nI know my boyfriend liked his chicken chimi, and I get the impression the food here is pretty good, and they do have some cool options.

How I always want to like you, and always walk away going, \"Oh yeah, I remember that.\"\n\nI lived two blocks down from Mad Mex for a good bit of college, so it was inevitable that we ended up here our fair share of times.  However, very rarely did our food-ordering go past chips and salsa, and each time I try to have food here, I realize why: I just don't like Tex-Mex or Cali-Mex or whatever sort of not-the-real-deal-Mexican food Mad Mex is.\n\nThat said, they do make a good margarita, and they do run a lot of specials.  The Oakland location has half-price menu items each evening after 11 (much, but not all of the menu qualifies for this), and two happy hours for cheap booze, including half-price Big Azz Margaritas (those are the 22-ouncers that often made for early bedtimes during college).\n\nThe drink happy hours and the food happy hours never coincide, but you can get your cheap drinks  from 4:30 - 6:30 (cheap wings at this point, too) or 9-11 each night, and if you stick around until after 11, you can get the half-price food menu.  Some times of the day are 21+, so you can have some margaritas and take advantage of the less-full restaurant before 11, then put in your food order once you've started drink round #2.\n\nOn our most recent visit, I tried to figure out what it is precisely that I don't like about their food, and I think it's the consistency of their tortillas.  They are a little doughy and thicker than what I'm used to.  Their fillings for quesadillas, burritos, and tacos just don't stick together like real Mexican food.\n\nThere are some things on the menu that truly are good, however.  Their waffle fries are seasoned quite well, and their chocolate dessert burrito is sinfully yummy.  At Thanksgiving time, the Gobbleritos (a burrito stuffed with all the fixins: turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn) are quite good.  But past that, the food is only average.\n\nThe Oakland location, as many others have pointed out, gets quite crowded during peak times.  The service is chancey, and sometimes you get a great waitress, and sometimes one who could care less.  However, the musical selections playing throughout the restaurant are almost always awesome, so I've always liked that bit of the atmosphere.\n\nOne final point, the bathrooms are rather sketchy.  Back when I lived down the street, I always preferred to just walk to my apartment when needed.  The Mad Mex bathroom just doesn't seem clean.  And don't have so many margaritas that you forget if you should go in the door marked with a nut or a bolt ;)\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a margarita and some chips, Mad Mex is okay.

The margaritas themselves are nothing too special; however people who are on their second may say differently (this includes me).\n\nThe food is fine but nothing special and the place is extremely loud, crowed, and dark. It takes a while to get a table and even if you just want to stand at the bar it is often hard to find a good spot. Also for college students there is the added irritation that they enforce a rule that if anyone at the table is under 21 then nobody can drink unless you have somebody over 25.", "user_id": "m7RckK61uL1v6M12fliKng", "business_id": "s5ZdjjFX3CS2uS6_oVH7CQ", "stars": 2}

{"text": "Mad Mex gets super crowded all the time for a reason.\n\nTheir \"Big Azz\" margaritas are nothing particularly special, but will knock you on your ass. Factor in their two-a-day happy hours featuring $7 margaritas and you're in for some economical, pleasant drinking.\n\nFood is half-off after 11, so if you're getting drunk munchies after imbibing on one (or three) margaritas at night you're in luck. It's pretty good too, they offer some creative dishes that, while blatantly inauthentic, satisfy. Portions are so big that even with drunk munchies I can only finish 3/4 of my meal.\n\nThe service is super patient and quick as well. Even when the place is packed with a bunch of drunk people servers never get snappy. Every time I've been hammered there a waiter has always politely asked me to move, and has put up with my significantly delayed reaction time.\n\nThe major con of Mad Mex is how loud and tiny it is. If you're there to drink at the bar there's very little standing room. If you're there to eat at a table expect to be bumping elbows with the person next to you. Even when it's not too crowded the restaurant is inexplicably loud, so don't bring a date here (unless you don't really want to hear what she's talking about, in which case do so as I have in the past).\n\nIn summary: go here during off hours for good food to avoid the crowds or during happy hours when you'll be too drunk to care about the crowds. Also, for anyone trying to get in using a fake, they're one of the stricter bars in Oakland so be careful.", "user_id": "ikjD_c5Qc4jBsTWSBq5ijg", "business_id": "s5ZdjjFX3CS2uS6_oVH7CQ", "stars": 4}

A garlicy spicy creamy pesto-type dressing that is also great to add as a dipping sauce for quesadillas and taquitos.

{"text": "I had been to this place more than a few times and tried the chicken in just about every shape and form. I've had the Chicken Tacos, the Chicken Burrito, Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Quesadilla. Someone on here calls it modern Mexican Food, I just call it fancy shmancy and artsy fartsy. No matter what I order it just tastes like it has too much pepper, a little sour and nothing like authentic mexican cuisine. First of all the Salsa sucks. It's just not good at all nor are the chips that go with it. I don't think many people are used to paying $4 or $5 for chips and salsa when they go to a Mexican place. I know I am not. In every other place on the planet It is free and usually arrives almost before you are handed your menus. Last time I went for lunch I tried the Tortilla soup. It had the consistency of a butternut squash soup with zero chicken inside. If I did not read it on the menu and was just handed a cup I would never have guessed what it was. Their Fajitas are painfully average, Not sure if you like paying over $10 for the equivalent of one thinly sliced half chicken breast and some fried peppers and onions. Just seem like less quality than I am used to recieving. The rice is mediocre and usually comes cold on the plate, the black beans have an over bearing peppery taste that I could definately do without. Their roasted red pepper sauce put overtop the Chimichange may be gourmet but it is too sour and tastes like stomach acid. Not really what I would call delicious or even a sought after flavor. I just never got this place. I think it is has more of a draw for people wanting to go drink in a trendy place that is popular with the 20 something dirty panty crowd. In my opinion if you want a good burrito and don't need to have a few drinks before eating it just walk into a Chipotle and pay your $6.50 and be on your way. Save yourself from overpriced food and over tipping the short stocky waitress with glasses, messy hair and no makeup on that seem to be in every Mad Mex.

We usually get the pico (usually very fresh and juicy), guac (consistently delicious and chunky), and the pineapple habanero which seems to vary depending on the season/produce. Sometimes it's straight spicy, sometimes it's a perfect balance of sweet pineapple and a spice that builds on the tongue. The color is usually a good indication of the heat (darker = spicier, yellower = sweeter). We always make sure to order a side of sour cream (which they usually don't charge for) to pair with the pineapple habanero... cuts the heat enough so I can enjoy it. \n\nMy boyfriend LOVES the wings. Mild San Francisco with blue cheese. He's also a huge fish taco fan and these were some of his favorite in Pittsburgh. I love the house salad with the lime-cilantro vinaigrette (one of the best dressings in Pittsburgh) and the tofu isn't bad either... tofu tacos = yum. Also developed a liking for their quesadillas... I'd usually order one with just cheese, grilled onions and peppers, and corn. Depending on the cook that day, it could be a let-down or it could be amazing.

{"text": "Mad Mex will always have a special place in my heart, and my stomach. And probably my liver too. I remember coming here with friends on my 21st birthday, and we all got big azz margaritas. And then some more margaritas. And then some more. And then it got hazy. Same with my senior year in college, when we would come for happy hour. Hazy as well. Given the size and tastiness of the margaritas and the great beer selection, you can see why there's a bit of haziness.\n\nAnyways, I definitely think that out of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Mad Mex is my favorite. The half-price menu at this location makes the deal even sweeter. My buddies and I would usually go to Fuel & Fuddle for half-price, but if we ever wanted to mix it up, we would make the trek to Mad Mex, for some wings or burritos. My favorite items are the Large San Francisco wings with bleu cheese, nachos grande, and the black bean dip. Seriously, that black bean dip is pretty epic, and I've found that nary another restaurant in the country has a black bean dip that good. Also, if you haven't tried the blue cornbread, you should. Incredibly moist, and did I mention it's blue? Overall, the prices are great too, and if all else fails, you can't go wrong with a simple bottomless chips and salsa order either. They're also pretty good at making vegan and vegetarian versions of most of the dishes on the menu, which helps when you've got an herbivore in your group.\n\nI do wish that it wasn't so crowded on the weekends, and to be fair, Mad Mex doesn't really serve authentic Mexican food, or even Tex-Mex for that matter. As long as you can get over these two facts, Mad Mex is an awesome place to have a big azz margarita, and grab some Tex-Mex-ish American bar food. Also, note that the Shadyside location does NOT have late night food specials like the Oakland location.\n\nNonetheless, I came back not too long ago, and I was glad to see that not much had changed. I'll still never get used to day drinking at Mad Mex. Since it's so dark inside, once you leave the restaurant, the sunlight will almost blind you, and people will think you're more intoxicated than you actually are, even though it's just the burst of light that's disorienting you. And the booze. \n\nAs I'll leave you to your Yelp Review reading, Mad Mex is an awesome bar to booze and grab some good food with friends, with a few small flaws here and there.

{"text": "True fact: I haven't been to a Mad Mex in over two years.  As you might guess from reading my review of the Shadyside Mad Mex, this is because I've generally been unimpressed with the quality of the food, and I'm not a fan of super-noisy places. However, I'd heard rumors, beginning last year, of a curious and delicious seasonal entree known as the Gobblerito--a burrito filled with turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes, with cranberry sauce on the side.  This fall, I vowed to try this chimeric creation, and receiving a $5 off coupon for being on the Big Burrito mailing list sealed the deal.  So, last night, I ventured over to the Oakland Mad Mex, which I'd never visited before, with a friend to consume the beast.\n\nMy friend and I started off with 12 oz. pumpkin pie margaritas--this month's margarita flavor--which, thanks to happy hour, were discounted to $3 each.  They were all right, but not quite as flavorful as other margarita flavors I've tried at Mad Mex.  After perusing the menu, she decided to order the portobello enchiladas, whereas I, needless to say, ordered the gobblerito.  Our food came out about 10-15 min. after ordering, and the food runners confused our orders, which I quickly (and passionately) corrected.  The gobblerito, while pretty substantial, wasn't as gargantuan as I'd pictured it--its dimensions were roughly 5\"x8\".  While it was quite delicious, savory, and interesting, I wasn't quite as blown away as I'd hoped to be by the experience.  I found the amount of gravy on it rather skimpy, and the contents weren't evenly distributed throughout the burrito. It was still pretty yummy, however!  Surprisingly, I was able to devour the whole thing in one sitting--although I considered stopping 3/4 of the way through but decided against it, given that there wouldn't have been sufficient leftovers to justify another meal.\n\nAlthough I didn't try my friend's enchilada, since I was too busy putting away the gobblerito, she told me that it was quite delicious.  However, she pointed out to me that, when she took out the leftovers for her lunch today, she found small pieces of chicken in it, which she hadn't noticed last night due to the dim lighting.  Fortunately, she isn't vegetarian, so this wasn't an issue for her, but this leads me to question their practices when it comes to vegetarian food preparation.\n\nService was generally good, although it was pretty busy at the time of our visit (6pm).  We were able to get a table right away with no problem.  As for the atmosphere, similar to the Shadyside location, it was quite dark and boisterous, but much smaller and more intimate.\n\nOverall, eating the gobblerito was an interesting experience, and I'd definitely recommend trying it if you haven't before.  It was good enough that I'd probably do it again next year--especially if I receive another coupon--but not perfect by any means.  Truth be told, the gobblerito is about the only food-related reason I'd revisit Mad Mex--though I'd be willing to come back for the margaritas, for sure!", "user_id": "9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA", "business_id": "s5ZdjjFX3CS2uS6_oVH7CQ", "stars": 4}

We arrived around 10:30pm and was starting to get crowded by the bar, since it was so late for normal dinner there were tables and we were promptly seated.  We started off with a Big Azz Strawberry Margarita on the rocks with salt and our friends ordered a Raspberry to split. They were on special 22oz for $7. They came out fast and were strong and had good flavor.  \n\nThe waitress reminded us that at 11pm the food would be half off, so she said if we wanted to wait a few more minutes with our drinks, she would be happy to bring out the chips and salsa and come back for our orders.  I thought this was really nice of her to make sure we got their late night (11pm-1am) special that features their menu at half price.\n\nI was kinda bummed they didn't have fajitas because I had been craving them, but my boyfriend and I happily settled for the Mad Mex Fajita Burrita with chicken. Also included inside was grilled peppers, onions, black beans and Monterey Jack cheese. We also got the California Grilled Salad with carnitas thanks to the suggestion of our waitress.  It did not disappoint,and was easily large enough for the two of us to split. The lime-cilantro vinaigrette dressing was the perfect addition to the carnitas and avocado in the salad. We were easily stuffed by the end and our bill came to under $20. \n\nThe atmosphere at Mad Mex is chill. Very fun and inviting place to hang with friends.

After sampling the majority of the menu, I really can't complain. While it's hardly authentic Mexican food, the menu options are unique and typically flavorful. Portions are large enough to leave you satisfyingly full. My absolute favorite item to order is the Kristy's big sister's red velvet quesadilla (Marinated chicken, grilled zucchini, spicy spinach, pico de gallo and Jack cheese). It's (relatively) healthy And always allows for leftovers the next day. The Carnitas quesadilla (Pork braised in beer, garlic and ancho chili rolled up in a wheat tortilla with roasted green chilis and served with slaw, pico de gallo and Jack cheese) is another stellar option and packs a bit more of a punch when it comes to the spiciness of the dish. As weird as it may sound, the coleslaw actually tastes really good when put inside the quesadilla (don't judge lol). The thai curry burrito (grilled steak, chicken, shrimp, tofu or portobello, with toasted peanuts, pineapple and Thai curry sauce. Topped with bean sprouts. Sweet-n-sour slaw) is another interesting choice I'd recommend and it packs a punch flavor wise as well. The margaritas are amazing, as fellow Yelpers have already detailed.

To keep morale up, the decision was made to order a round of margaritas before happy hour ended. What came next was the lone bright spot in an evening filled with disappointment and broken promises. The margaritas were an oasis of elation in a dessert of sadness. But the exuberance did not last long. Shortly after, we learned that a table had been vacant the entirety of our stay.

I was shocked by how little had changed as well as a number of other things. One, THERE ARE NO CORN TORTILLAS IN A MEXICAN FREAKING RESTAURANT. This bothers me on a number of levels. One, IT IS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. It makes me wonder if the owner has ever been to Mexico or even to a taco truck in Miami. Two, I am allergic to flour. I love Mexican restaurants because it is USUALLY so easy for me to order. Three, I like corn tortillas. You don't have to be authentic to just have the tortillas frozen somewhere for that person who like Mexican food to be a little more like Mexican food. I am cool with Tex/Pit- Mex, but seriously, this is ridiculous. \n\nSo, we got the nachos. Which was a bunch of American cheese literally dumped on the nachos, black olives from a can, and some pretty good shredded chicken. There wasn't any salsa, jalapenos, sour cream, nothing.

{"text": "I really wanted to like this place.  We were driving through Dormont, saw all of the neon lights and turned around to check it out.  There was a \"Victory\" sign, which is a sign of excellent Pennsylvania beer, and after living in Southern California for eight years, I became quite the Mexican food junkie.  About a mile up the road is the place where I got my first sampling of Mexican Food in the 70s, Jose and Tony's, which has lost its luster under the new ownership, so Mexi-Casa sounded like our new hope in my old stomping ground.\n\nWell, they did have good beer on tap - ONE good beer.  Victory Hop Devil is an old favorite, and I buy it often.  There was something not quite right about the 22-ounce Hop Devil that I was served. (Besides the whopping $7.25 purchase price...)  It didn't taste right, and I know what it's supposed to taste like.\n\nThe menu got my hopes up.  It was quite extensive, and I quickly decided on the \"Soon-To-Be-Famous\" steak burrito, because nobody can resist advertising like that.  My partner got a trio of tacos - grilled chicken, taco meat, and steak.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food to be prepared, we munched a basket of tortilla chips and salsa, which I immediately identified as being produced by Reyna Foods in the Strip District.  Yay!  Reyna makes the best chips and salsa in the city.  SCORE!  We loved the chips and salsa and didn't mind paying $5.50.  My partner's margarita was pretty good, but the bartender looked at us with a blank stare on her face when I asked if she could get us a BLUE margarita, my favorite drink up the street at Jose and Tony's.  Nope.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I admired the presentation, but was quickly disappointed, because despite the fact that my burrito was quite a handful, it was absolutely the most bland tasting burrito I had ever had.  All I could taste was virtually unseasoned rice and a very large amount of refried beans.  The steak inside had zero flavor, and I had to pile on large amounts of the Reyna salsa to get any flavor at all.  Unseasoned meat piled up with rice and beans in a large flour tortilla does NOT a burrito make...\n\nMy partner's tacos were three different meats, but were virtually indistinguishable.  The ingredients had virtually no seasoning whatsoever.  In fact, we shared quite a snicker when we looked inside the \"steak\" taco, which was highlighted by little strips of sliced up \"Steak-Ums,\" totally unseasoned, overcooked, cardboard pieces of \"meat.\"\n\nWell, the people working there were very nice, and they had a pretty good crowd when we walked in.  I decided that I will give this place another chance and try something else on the menu next time, but it is my sincere hope that in the meantime, someone will bring the blandness factor to the owner's attention.  Even if my bill had been half of what it was, I would have walked out thoroughly dissatisfied, because the place is actually pretty nice, and the servers are very nice, and it's in one of my favorite parts of town.  It really deserves one-and-a-half stars for tonight, anyway...\n\nI would have given this dining experience a SINGLE star had it not been for the fact that the people working there were so friendly.", "user_id": "4-3IU5uUH90m21TWbZhhnA", "business_id": "SQHO1U7XsmuEAKX1j7yIMA", "stars": 2}

The food was a little inconsistent but I was never expecting top notch Tex Mex. When I had heard it reopened I was excited to see what improvements were made. Unfortunately, somehow this mediocre place became awful. My roommate and I were a little late but we're really craving a Bloody Mary. What we got was no more than tomato juice with pepper in it. I didn't taste any vodka at all. For $8, I would at least expect some celery salt or horseradish. If the bartender didn't have the ingredients to make the drinks we would have been happier picking something else.\n\nOur food made the drinks seem impressive. I ordered the \"wanna iguana\" burrito. The description says that it has spicy chicken, queso, rice and beans. I opted out of the beans just because sometimes I feel that they tend to take over the burrito. The burrito was disgusting. The queso was too thin and just saturated everything. The chicken was also texturally similar to that from a can. There was not an ounce of spice to it either. The oddest part about the burrito is that the rice had corn and peas in it. PEAS. Weird. I have been to actual Mexican restaurants where they use several vegetables that one would not expect. My great grandmother put potatoes in her beef enchiladas. But this is not a place where creative cooking is expected so it just seemed more like the rice was a mix with dehydrated corn and peas in it.

I have eaten there twice since they reopened just to make sure it wasn't a fluke or a bad day for the cook. Everything my fianc\u00e9 and I got was completely tasteless, no spice, and overpriced. The chicken and vegetables in the burritos appeared to be from frozen veggies or cans. The rice was dry. There was no sauce or seasoning. The wings didn't even have sauce or spices. The tacos were flavorless beef with a couple pieces of iceberg lettuce. Most appalling was that the guacamole was TEN dollars, and it was basically just smashed avocado with nothing else in it. I have never paid that much for guacamole, even for the best or large quantities of fresh made guacamole on the Tex-Mex border. It was honestly baffling. Most Pittsburgh bars have cheap food.

Hire a chef, I don't know who's cooking now but I made better food as a teenager after school... And price your food according to your demographic. You are not an upscale restaurant in San Francisco.

{"text": "I tried Taco Loco one Saturday afternoon a few months ago when I had one of my very rare, but very strong Mexican cravings (which really has more to do with having an early afternoon margarita then it does the cuisine).   The first offputting feature of this restaurant was the fact that I had to request, and then was subsequently charged, for what ended up being the most unimpressive set of chips and salsa I've ever had.  Since I wasn't impressed with the salsa, I ordered the guacamole hoping it would be better.  But to my great surprise,  I discovered what is likely the only guacamole on earth that does not make me want to grab a spatula and clean the bowl.  It is very difficult to spoil guacamole for me, but they did it with the garlicky-smokey-not quite sure if it's supposed to taste that way or not-flavor.  I was very sad about my chips and salsa/guacamole experience since that's usually my favorite part of \"Mexican dining\".  Well, that and the margaritas.  \n\nThe tacos were equally questionable as the guac. I believe I ordered the carnitas tacos and something about them was just....off.  Another reviewer mentioned old, wilted lettuce and I experienced the same thing, which just makes you wonder about the rest of the ingredients.  My husband ordered fish tacos and wasn't impressed either.  After tasting my carnitas tacos, I was really glad I hadn't ordered fish tacos.  That just seems like something that doesn't come out right too often, and here it could have been scary.   \n\nAs for the margarita, nothing sticks out in my mind other than the fact that I only ordered one, which probably means it was just, eh.  :-)  \n\nWe won't be back here.

It won the award for the absolute worst \"Mexican\" food I have ever put in my mouth.  \n\nWe went on a lazy Sunday afternoon, around 1:30, and we saw that they had some lunch specials.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to try Mexican food in Pittsburgh because since I've been here...I haven't seen any.  The standard chips and salsa was blah.  The tortilla chips seemed (days?) old and were really cold.  The salsa was decent.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the pork carnita tacos and I am a huge fan of chili rellenos, and so I wanted to test them out here.  Big effin mistake.  A chili relleno (although there are variations of the rule) is a pablano pepper, with an egg battered crust, stuffed with cheese and meat.  This was an abomination of a chili relleno...a defected, ugly step-brother, if you will.  Instead, what I got was a thin slice of a GREEN BELL PEPPER, with a greasy, yellow mound of ground beef, and a 3 inch hunk of melted white cheese on top.  It was sitting, along with my rice and canned re-re-refried bean, on a pool of yellow grease.\n\nDon't go there.  I beg of you.  My boyfriend and I made jokes after we left about how our stomachs were really mad at us and just wanted to be left alone for a while.\n\n*Note - When paying the check I asked the waitress if the owner was Mexican.

Our server got us some hot sauce which was much needed, as the dishes themselves didn't seem to have too much spice.  My boyfriend got the chimichanga, which he enjoyed.

Prices were a bit higher than I'd hoped - the food is fine, but also uninspired and leaves a brick feeling in your tummy.\n\nChips and salsa were pretty plain too - the salsa was sort of saucy, lacking the tasty tomato and pepper chunks that normally give it texture.

{"text": "So, I used to think this place was reasonable.  Being from California, I've missed good Mexican food so much that I sometimes find myself saying things like, \"Maybe Chipotle really isn't that bad...\" or things like that.  And for a while, Cuzamil kept me from tearing my hair out when all I wanted was some greasy, hole in the wall Mexican food.  Cuz when I say I want Mexican, that's what I want - not the fresh ingredient gourmet stuff that they serve at Cantina, but the greasy spoon stuff that is dirt cheap and is essentially what you are craving after a good night out on the town.  I'm not talking foodie stuff here.\n\nAnyway, so Cuzamil used to satisfy that for me.  But I went recently and man was that pretty bad.  I ordered the enchiladas especiales, which were supposed to come with avocado salad (which is really the only reason I got it).  What I got were two enchiladas that were gooey, tasteless, the tortilla was chewy and clearly stale... and no avocado salad.  I asked about it, and the server came back and said they didn't have any avocado.  So... lemme get this straight.  You don't have a major ingredient, and you're not going to ask the patron if they want to change their order?  AND you're going to charge them as though they got the entree they wanted, rather than two lifeless enchiladas, which are much cheaper?  Someone's business radar was clearly broken.\n\nSo, sure I'm a little bitter.

I know it's not the easiest thing to come by in Pittsburgh, and even tougher if you're sticking to the city limits, but Cuzamil hasn't disappointed me yet.\n\nOur first visit was actually the daring decision of going to a tiny little Mexican spot on Cinco de Mayo last year.  Natually, it was packed to overflowing, but everything about our trip was excellent.  The service has always been great, even when we were elbow-to-elbow with our fellow Cinco-de-Mayo-ers.  Any time there was a delay in our food reaching us, we were informed, and the servers were on top of refills (of drinks and chips) to tide us over.\n\nAnd there's something about their homemade margarita pitchers that gets me each time.  There's that tiny bit of bite in each sip that separates it from the average margarita.\n\nI do fear that I get the same thing every time I go here, which is the chicken quesadilla.  It's gigantic, and comes with the little Mexican food salad (the shredded lettuce/sour cream/guac/pico mix), beans, and rice.  It's easily enough for my meal and leftovers the next day, and I like getting that value for my money.  I always want to try other things that catch my eye on the menu, but I seem to keep coming back to this massive quesadilla.\n\nThe chips and salsa are homemade as well, and on our latest visit, we tried the appetizer platter that came with mozzarella sticks.  I know cheese sticks are not really what come to mind when you hear \"Mexican food,\" but they had a little bit of zest to them that made it okay in my book.  There was something reminiscient of the composition of the fresh, crispy homemade chips in the cheese stick breading.\n\nEach time we've gone, the service has been great.  On Cinco de Mayo, everyone dining at the restaurant got to pick trinkets out of a bag of Tecate swag.  I got one of those little dresses for your beer bottle, in the design of a traditional Mexican poncho (with Tecate emblazoned across the front, of course).  It's the little details like that, plus the top-notch service and delicious food that keeps me coming back.\n\nAlso, look for deals in Clipper magazine or Groupon.

The table top was made of complete beer bottle caps which i thought was very unique. I've never seen that in a  restaurant or bar before so i thought it was pretty interesting. The food here was decent, tasted like similar places I've been too but nothing unfamiliar. I did enjoy their burritos more than usual, i thought they were bigger than most places.\n\nI always love the sides in mexican dishes. My favorite is the rice and refried beans. i wish they would have given us larger tortillas when my hubby order the fajita platter but i guess smaller portions help you control more of what you eat. The one good thing about this place was the Margaritas. They make a delicious classic margarita but I wasn't too thrilled about the price. they offer about 3 to 4 different sizes and almost 5 varieties of flavors. I go lemon lime because i was never too thrilled with strawberry or watermelon.\n\nThis little place is along the strip in squirrel hill on Murray Ave. If you go up the hill it's on your right and if your going down, it's on the left.

We got our food at 9:21pm. During this 15 minutes wait, no one ever checked on us or anything. \n\nBefore coming we purchased a $10 for $20 coupon on LocalFlavor. But when we showed this coupon to Cindy before getting our check, she told us that SHE WAS TOLD that this coupon is only applied for some \"two-person dining\". And when we asked her what exactly two person dining was she said something like we need to order two entree or something. I can't remember what exactly she said but her point was we couldn't use our coupon. The price wasn't ridiculous so we were fine paying with cards. \n\nBut then I went back to the website where we purchased the coupon and there was not a single word about this \"2 person dining\". So I decided to talk to the owner about this. Not to get our money back but to find out what exactly is happening. We asked Cindy who the owner was and guess what? SHE IS THE OWNER HERSELF. So what was the \"I was told that this coupon can only apply to two person dining\".

You can get your items customized pretty much anyway you want as long as they have the ingredients. In particular, the meats are all very good and well cooked, unlike Qdoba which tends to dry everything out. The pork in particular is excellent. One nice thing:  you can get tacos priced per each one. So if you only want 1 taco or want 15 tacos, they will accommodate that. The price per taco is 1/3 of the menu price (where you get 3 tacos). \n\nOne other point I want to make is if you eat Paleo or Whole30 or similar. It is surprisingly hard to eat at Chipotle on those programs. While the chain boasts of their sustainable practices in regards to ingredients, they often prepare items with non-Paleo ingredients. For example, except for the pork, all of their meats have soybean oil (Paleo/Whole30 no-no). Same goes for their fajita vegetables. This severely limits what you can order if you are eating on these programs. In particular, I wish they would change how they cook the veggies, as I really enjoy them. Chipotle does make changes to their menu items (for example, they just made their pinto beans vegetarian friendly) so it may be worth reaching out to them to request a change. Anyway, just something to keep in mind. Luckily, the pork is so good  and the red salsas Paleo-friendly I usually put that on a basic salad and am good to go. \n\nThis location is a little small with limited parking, so be forewarned it can be a pain during busy lunch/dinner hours. \n\nDespite my issues with the use of soybean oils, definitely a good place for a quick meal.", "user_id": "SdQNhy_YaPCsuLetXR5WIQ", "business_id": "XtQgLRofbvrivJyinGZtkQ", "stars": 4}

For ingredients you can choose from the following:\n\nGrilled Chicken or Grilled Steak (both marinated in smoky chipotle chili adobo.), \n\nBarbacoa (spicy, shredded beef, braised with chipotle chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, \nand cloves.) \n\nCarnitas (pork braised with thyme, bay, juniper berries and cracked black pepper.) \n\nFajita Vegetables(Bell peppers and sweet red onion saut\u00e9ed with fresh oregano.) \n\nFour different salsas:\n\nFresh Tomato Salsa (Mild) (Diced tomatoes with sweet red onions, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.\n\nRoasted Chili-Corn Salsa (Medium) (Sweet white corn, roasted poblano peppers, sweet red onions, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.)\n\nTomatillo Green Chili Salsa (Medium) (Fire-roasted tomatillos, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1o peppers, sweet red onion, cilantro, garlic, cumin and oregano.)\n\nTomatillo-Red Chili Salsa (Hot) (Chile de arbol, tomatillo, garlic, cumin and Tabasco sauce.\n\nPinto beans, Black beans, Cilantro Lime Rice, White Cheddar and Jack Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce, Sour Cream . They also offer chips & guacamole and a kid's menu as well.\n\nI went with a steak burrito with black beans, fajita veges, roasted chili corn salsa, lettuce, cilantro lime rice and cheese.

Unfortunately, nothing in the burrito bowl stood out aside from the fact that somehow, it all managed to taste so bland. Even the tons of cilantro didn't stand out. The guacamole tasted like the plasticy store bought stuff, the sour cream had no flavor, both salsas from the bar tasted straight up strange, and everything else managed to have no flavor. Well, I'll give the queso credit because who doesn't like nasty ol' nacho cheese?

{"text": "Moe's to me is the place to go when I can't get to Chipotle. That's actually exactly how I ended up eating here last week - the line for Chipotle was just too long to stand in considering some coworkers and I had a work meeting we had to get to an hour or so later.\n\nWhen we walked into Moe's we got right in line and were impressed by how quickly it moved. The staff here are definitely really fast and efficient - I actually totally forgave them for asking to repeat myself a couple times just because you could see the whirlwind pace they had to work at during the lunch rush to keep things moving. Kudos to them for clarifying things rather than risking messing up my order just to keep the line moving. We admittedly made fun of the menu set-up while waiting, though, since none of us got why they felt the need for funny order names here. 90% of the names don't tell you anything about what you're ordering, making them totally pointless and even potentially confusing. And I mean, are fancy order names really helping you compete with places like Chipotle?\n\nAnyway, all of our food was tasty enough, although my \"Overachiever\" tacos weren't particularly deserving of their name. They were fine and I enjoyed them, but they weren't exceptional either; if anything I think more meat and black beans would have balanced out the insane amount of guacamole they came with.

Unfortunately for us the only open table we could get was right by those doors, so throughout the meal the door constantly opened and slammed shut, resulting in cold winter air drafts and a small headache on my part from the noise.\n\nAll in all, this Moe's does offer very quick service and ok food, but you do need to watch out for certain parts of the seating area.

So, in deference to her opinion let me quite upfront with what she deservedly does not like about the place.  Two words... \"no substitutions\".  Now, if you suffer from the affliction of being a picky eater...first, my condolences...secondly, you know the need to have some control over the food presented to you.  This is not an option for kevin sousa's menu at yo moma,,,woops! I mean \"yo rita\".  The other issue is that the bartender was less than expected and made a drink that sounded delicious on the menu nearly undrinkable.  The space itself is quite pleasant.  There are high ceilings, a big bar to the right, plenty of tables.  your appropriate amount of hipsters and yuppies (and I'm using these terms (including this yuppie) in the most unflattering sense possible.  There also are some interesting candles and what looks like copper artwork on the wall.  Here is what I really like about the place....\"the food\".  I don't know of anywhere in the burgh' where I can get such interesting tacos as \"freshwater eel\", soft shell blue crab\" or \"chicken livers\",,, for a \"foodie\" (another word I despise!) the ability to have simple street food reinvented with interesting ingredients is a bit of a revelation especially when cooked properly, which for the most part these were.  I had the chicken livers taco which was served on a flour tortilla with shredded cabbage, perfectly season and flavored fried chicken livers, bacon,,, lemon garlic aioli and guava (although the guava was barely noticeable).  This was $5 and was a nice portion of my first chicken liver taco,,, another first was the duck taco.  The duck was cooked perfectly medium, think of the best piece of juicy moist duck breast you've had with a little crispy skin and this was that.  However, imagine wrapped in a tortilla with fresh cilantro, jalapeno and a nice fig chutney.  Annie was able to eat the chicken livers, but that was about where her dining experience ended.  If the service was a bit better, the drink prepared properly this may have earned four stars. It may even deserve 3 1/2 stars now but that's not an option.

They seemed out of place, like they should be working at a smokey dive bar instead of a hip taco joint, but they gave me a basket of free chips so i was happy.  I ordered the flank steak taco and the shrimp taco.   The flank steak was juicy, full of flavor and cooked perfectly.   The mushroom mixture inside the taco was a nice compliment to the meat.  The shrimp taco was advertised as spicy and for once , at a restaurant, the advertisment lived up to reality.   It didnt burn my mouth off but it caught my attention.  The cilantro and citrus flavors made this a predictable tasting taco, but it still was enjoyable\n\n Both tacos, chips and a beer ran me about $14.

I was impressed by both, but right now, I am a tad more smitten with Yo Rita because their tacos tasted fantastic!\n\nAt the server's recommendation of two tacos per person, my dinner companion and I ordered four to share. We got: the escolar, the pork shoulder, the duck confit, and the bahn mi. While the pork shoulder was very good (could have used a little less meat, a few more slices of granny smith apples), the other three were amazing. The escolar taco was like a giant tortilla wrapped sushi -- the fish was succulent and sweet against a supporting cast of bok choi, shiitaki, and aji amarillo. The bahn mi combined fatty pork belly with velvety chicken liver pate, then heated everything up with jalapeno and sweet chile sauce. The duck confit packs up juicy duck pieces with mushroom, bacon, and slices of brussle sprouts -- a hearty bite of Southern France in a to-go package.\n\nAlthough I did not try any, the menu lists many vegetarian-friendly options.\n\nFinally, about the service: we showed up on a Saturday evening around 7pm, so I came mentally prepared to wait 90+ minutes per other reviewers' comments. It really wasn't that bad though. The hostess took down my cell number, and we were free to roam about Carson. They called us back around 8pm and we were promptly seated and served.

It was with optimism and an eager appetite I ventured to Yo Rita, driving to the dreaded Southside just for the new meal experience. See paragraph two if you only care about the food. First off, our server was TERRIBLE, the hostile check-on-you-from-afar-but-avert-eyes-when-you-seem-to-be-looking-for-her type. Bare minimal attention was given to us, her only table at 4:30pm on a weekday, while another sweet server danced around and took care of people with a smile, including us on an occasion. The sweet one gave us that knowing, apologetic look, while I am sorry for anyone who has to work alongside people who carry their personal problems with them everywhere they go. And I am sorry that one bad egg can really spoil a restaurant review. When I ask a question about ingredients and you don't know the answer, ask the kitchen; don't tell me that you don't think so and try to talk me out of wanting to know for sure. Or, just lie with a confident answer and hope I don't die as a result of an allergic reaction! And when it's time to pay, you might as well promptly get the hell rid of us instead of subjecting us to your bitchin' conversation behind the bar.\n\nChips and salsa rocked! Some people with a competent server even got a salsa refill! Jicama salad, pretty darn good! Would have been happy for the meal to end there! Instead, two of us shared three ambitious tacos which fell flat. As others have mentioned, the beet taco's combination of flavors doesn't quite work, nor does it even taste interesting. I expected shredded beets, but they were big chunks which kept falling out, I lost a couple to the floor. Send me back to finishing school before I call a 5 second rule! At least I avoided droppage on my petticoat (hoes b clubbin' lookin' fine for dos men wid somethin' fat in they pocket, beware). On to the mushroom. Nothing wild about cremini mushrooms in my opinion! I was hoping for a mix of different mushrooms, as suggested by \"wild and cultivated\" on the menu. Guess they were just appealing to my thus described sensibilities. The tofu was probably my least anticipated, but favorite of the tacos, and I don't remember why. For dessert, I drank some root liquor drink with soy milk and malted something; it was a victorious finish before the final count-down. Partner's margarita was also excellent.\n\nInterior was fine and at first they were playing some really fitting (ie. to the logo) garage and surfer guitar rock. By the end, they were playing the worst droning love ballads of all time, who knew there was a station for that? Puke. \n\nCouple o' days later I tried Round Corner Cantina's seitan tacos.

She loudly barks orders at them in front of customers (a big faux pas in all of the restaurants I've ever worked in) and uses a very condescending and sarcastic tone when speaking to them, again in front of customers. She certainly isn't any nicer to customers, although I haven't been scolded or snapped at, yet. This makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience, especially if you're eating at the bar where you're close to a lot of the action. \n\n2. They need just one more server on the floor on Friday and Saturday nights. Each time I've been to Yo Rita when they're busy, our server has been too weeded to even say 'thank you' when dropping our credit card slips off. Our drink order has taken as long as our food to arrive. The servers always look stressed out and overwhelmed. Given the small size of the restaurant, and the bussers and food-runners also working the floor, the only thing I can conclude is that they are short-staffed. And obviously they don't have a manager supporting them and backing them up with they need her to. \n\nConsidering how cold the manager is to customers, perhaps she wants servers who aren't overly friendly and attentive. That's fine, I don't like a server who talks to me like I'm five years old and asks me how everything is a million times. Friendly and attentive Yo Rita's servers are not, but something tells me it's a reaction to poor management, rather than a business decision. \n\nI think the food at Yo Rita is really great, and it could be a Mexican version of Point Brugge--warm and cozy neighborhood restaurant, you go there because you want the food as well as the atmosphere--but they've really got to work on the front of the house situation ASAP.", "user_id": "Gme7OsXL-KMv334cvpy6Wg", "business_id": "UK51LgJRJ8_LUQQPZ5zfxw", "stars": 3}

Delicious little diced, fried potatoes and the mushrooms and cheese made for a nice little savory taco.  The black-eyed pea taco was nice, with curry, garbanzos, spinach, and cucumber raita.  \n\nThe duck confit taco was by far the favorite - the mole sauce gave it a great smoky flavor, and what made these really stand out were the toasted almonds which added a wonderful crunchiness and sweetness to each bite.\n\nParking near Carson Street was a bit of a challenge, but we snagged a street parking spot nearby after a few minutes of searching.  \n\nOn a Saturday evening at 7:15, we walked in and got the last available table for two.

I ordered the flank steak and shredded chicken tacos and they were the best tacos I have had in my life. It was a smart call making a restaurant cater to 2 specialties, and they got them down pretty well. In addition, their margaritas were also a treat. I had a ginger lime margarita (more like, 2) mostly because I could barely taste the alcohol. My girlfriends had the classic margarita, but I saw many other mojito/margaritas on the menu, so next time I come back in the next month or so, I will be ordering something different.

There is always hope found in the form of a well made libation. \n\nService can be painfully slow in between tacos.

Since then, other places have opened (Smoke, Round Corner), but no one else seems to be able to pull of the experimental taco thing quite like Yo Rita.\n\nThe ever-changing menu keeps the samplings fresh and when you find one...or two...or three...or in my case, FOUR tacos that you love, you need to get back as much as possible because they won't last for too long. As my wife found out, her favorite - the brussel sprout taco - disappeared with the seasonal menu update after only getting to enjoy it twice. Unfortunately, that's the way it's played, folks. Haha.\n\nThe starters are also usually really good. On the current menu, the albondigas (bison meatballs) are excellent - albeit a bit spicy - and the patatas bravas are tasty! I just wish they'd bring back the mini chorizo corn dogs. Amazing.\n\nI would give Yo Rita 5 stars, but with the experimentation sometimes comes tacos that just don't work for me. That's not to say they won't be awesome to other people, though. There's also the rare occasion where the quality seem inconsistent. For example, we went last night to try the new menu, and the rock shrimp taco seemed to have shrimp shell in it. The flavors were good, but no one likes shell. Of course, the rest of my tacos were excellent...and considering I ate 5 tacos, 4 out of 5 great ones makes my rating easy to figure out.\n\nYo Rita also has some excellent daily taco specials and great mixed drinks...oh and the free chips and salsa are awesome!\n\nThe service is also a positive. They don't have a lot of waitstaff, but the small team usually does an incredible job, and the food comes out quickly.\n\nThe cost adds up quickly, though, and it's tempting to order a lot.

There's a variety of unique tacos. These are not authentic, Mexican tacos so don't go there thinking that. These are completely 'Americanized' with tacos such as the \"crispy eggplant\" or the \"braised bbq chicken\" tacos. They have a respectable wine and alcohol list as well as appetizers.

The four of us were pretty impressed with our first visit. \n\nThe restaurant is on the smaller size, but cozy with inviting decor. \n\nI ordered the Hibiscus Margarita which was a nice variation from the traditional margarita I always order. My only complaint is that this particular margarita is served in a martini glass, where as the other margaritas are served in larger margarita glasses. They were all the same price, not sure why they varied on size. \n\nThe tacos were amazing. There are also so many vegetarian options to pick  from! Between the four of us, we had the Santa Cruz, Calamari, Salmon, Cuban, Mushroom and Trout tacos. The fact that there is a glossary in the back of the menu to explain certain ingredients really shows how unique the flavorful combinations really are. We are always looking for new foods to try, so this was perfect for broadening our horizons. Picky eaters may not be a fan, however. There is nothing plain on this menu!\n\nOur bill was almost $140.00 between the four of us, so this is definitely not a place you go to frequently if you can't afford to spend $30+/person on one meal.

I thought it would be cool and light... my stomach was unhappy with this selection.\n\nThe tacos here sound really cool - \"Santa Cruz Style Fish Taco\" and \"Chorizo Taco\" were my selections.  Please keep in mind - these aren't dishes.  These are individual tacos.  They weren't large.  They weren't PACKED with awesomeness... they were just OK.  I will say the Chorizo Taco tasted like breakfast - chorizo sausage, maple glaze, topped with a sunny side up egg (mine was not very runny unfortunately).  Not bad, but not worth the $7 price tag.  I was less impressed with the Fish Taco - it was ... flavorless.  What happened to spice and seasoning you normally get with tacos or Mexican food, in general?  I want some FLAVA, Yo!!\n\nAfter balancing out the pros and cons, I settled with a 3.

One is a milder salsa and the other is just a touch spicy. The chips are warm and delicious, beware that you could easily ruin your appetite as you get free refills on the chips. \n\nDRINKS - I've had a margarita here a few times and they were good if you're into that. I'm more of a beer drinker and they have some beers on tap as well as Modelo, Tecate, Corona etc. \n\nTACOS - I've never had a taco I didn't like here. They change up their menu now and again but always have a few that stay. The Santa Cruz is great and so is the BBQ Chicken for people not willing to venture out to their more exotic choices. I've always found that two tacos is more than enough for me and usually females are completely full after one taco. The prices run from $6-$9 usually, but as I mentioned two is more than enough. \n\nThe space is a bit small so blast of cold air from the door can be a bit uncomfortable depending on which table you sit at, but they usually keep the heat up pretty high to combat that so it's not such a big deal.", "user_id": "ye3lluQeriCxkPjhl2REGQ", "business_id": "UK51LgJRJ8_LUQQPZ5zfxw", "stars": 4}

Ray and I wanted to take advantage of the relatively nice weather (42' and cloudy) and go for a quick walk.  A client of mine had told me about this place and was pretty adament that it is the best authentic mexican in the Pittsburgh area.  We all know the usual spots (el camp, ray azteca, etc.).  However, I hadn't heard of this place.  THe place is pretty convenient.  Head down 6th and make a left on wood st. about a block away.  The relatively small storefront hides a surprisingly large restaurant.  We walk in and there is a line at the door and almost every table filled.  The place is pretty massive with a big bar in the middle of the area and small rooms tucked away on the sides.  We were lucky enough to find a spot in one of the nooks after only a short wait.  The place looks like you would expect, colors and decorations just like anywhere else.  The corner rooms are nice however because the one we were in had a plasma and a couple of couches in addition to a couple tables.  The tables are a little too close together and don't provide much privacy when it's crowded.  I suggest if you're going for lunch to go after 1 PM.  Waitress greets us quickly and is very friendly and they all seem genuinely filled with glee at their packed restaurant.  She brings over the tortilla chips which are okay albeit not warm and lacking a little salt.  She comes back pretty quickly and we place our order.  I was told the guacamole is a must have, so we order it and it arrives pretty quickly and the guy prepares tableside.  It's a big morter set and he asks how hot we like it.  We like it spicy, so he puts a bunch of jalapeno, cilantro, citrus, etc... and it's super delicious.  Maybe the best I've ever had.  Now, my only complaint is that it's a bit overpriced.  He used maybe 1/2 of an avocado and it was good for only a few chips worth.  Plus, much of the avocado was lost because it was in the crevases of the morter.  However, it's worth getting at least once because it really is good.  Ray, gets the chefs quesadilla which was okay, nothing too interesting and quite frankly a little bland and maybe a smaller portion than he would have hoped.  I get three tacos.  They have a two taco special for $7, but they had so many options I had to try more than two.  I order the lamb taco, which is good braised lamb served with cilantro and rice.  I also order the chorizo taco, which is certainly my favorite.  The sausage is spicy and flavorful and works well with the small soft tortilla shell and the flavor of the rice.  Lastly, I tried the chicken with pumpkin seed (?) sauce which was okay...actually, I was expecting a more bold or interesting flavor.  My only other small complaint is that it was close to an hour between the time we ordered and ate our entrees'.  I can see giving this place four stars in an update in the future.

{"text": "yelp reviews can sometimes be deceiving. this was probably one of the prime examples. it's really tough for me not to give the benefit of the doubt in terms of service and quality of food, but with this place, i found it too difficult to give it to them.\n\nmy friend and i arrived at this restaurant after i told my friend about the decent reviews of this place on yelp.  we were seated promptly, as there were only 4 people at the bar and 2 other tables occupied.  The waitress had a heavy polish accent, and her background/demeanor came to be a major hindrance throughout the whole meal.\n\nWe were first served chips and salsa. Upon feeling the chip and taking the first bite, i instantly had the image of a grid of heat lamps flash through my head.  Indeed, it was the suspiciously hot but very un-fresh taste that had infected my mouth. the salsa helped to alleviate this pickle, but it could not make up for the fact that we were given old, lifeless, and so few chips.  Upon asking whether refills were free, we were told that another tiny basket of chips would cost us $2, half the price of a family pack of tortilla chips at a market (not to say that market tortilla chips taste better than a theoretically fresh chip here).\n\nupon making our quick decision of ordering tacos, the waitress came from the back of the restaurant.  my friend began (slowly so as to be comprehensible), \"can i get a carne asada taco?\"......\n\n....then came an awkward silence while she stared at him. she then asked \"you want a taco?\" \"yes.\" \"what kind of taco?\" \"carne asada...\" \":: looks at the menu where my friend is pointing to the word carne asada::...oh ok ...car-ne a-sa-da.....\"   my friend had to go through the same process for the two other tacos  he got.  good thing i got a similar order.  we also ordered the made-tableside guacamole. i was telling my friend, \"i hope the waitress doesn't end up being the one to prepare our guacamole...\" and from the side of my eye, the waitress came, holding a mortar and pestle with one shaking hand (those things are heavy, let alone for a on-the-thin-side waitress holding it with one hand), and a tray of avocados and other guacamole ingredients with the other hand.  \n\nshe placed the mortar and pestle right in the center of our 2 person table. two things wrong with this: 1. there's absolutely no more space on the table now. 2. i don't think the physical motion of using the mortar and pestle is good for the structure of the table. as if the moment couldn't get more awkward, she put all the ingredients in the mortar and proceeded to start using the pestle. like a geo metro trying to climb a san francisco street,  she struggled. it showed in her labored motions, it showed on her face. i tried to make conversation with my friend while she was doing this, so that it wouldn't seem that we were staring her down. during one hit of her pestle, i caught what i termed as \"collateral damage\". some liquid splashed onto my shirt, confirming my proposition that this should have been done on a separate cart or something. she stopped, nervously laughed and said \"sorry\", and continued mashing the avocados while nervously laughing. i finally told her to stop before she finished, since i told her that i liked it slightly chunkier.  she repeated what i said (probably out of nervousness), \"you like it this way...haha... ok....\"  the guacamole was too liquidy, presumably from the wrong ratio of onions and/or lemon juice to the amount of solids.\n\nour tacos came out 15-20 minutes after this ordeal, and to describe the meat as dry is conservative at best.  the food itself was colder than lukewarm, nearing room temperature.  we finished our food as fast as we could and headed out.\n\nnever coming back here again.", "user_id": "oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg", "business_id": "9r4gq8LVewal0uTnLiS1zQ", "stars": 1}

We stood there for quite a while as she ignored us, and finally I told my husband that we should just leave.  At that point, my husband asked her if anyone was going to come to seat us and she just looked at us blankly like an idiot and grabbed a few menus & seated us.\n\n When she asked us what we wanted to drink, I ordered a cocktail (because I don't drink beer), and she told me they didn't have it.

We ordered burritos and we proceeded to sit and wait for at least a half hour, while we watched a large table of Mexicans (presumably friends or relatives) get golden treatment by having several servers running back and forth to cater to them, while we sat watching our waitress taking care of one of the Mexican's infant.  \n\nAfter the burritos finally came, they were the most pathetic burritos I ever had.  I ordered a chicken burrito, and my husband ordered a chorizo one.

What I will say about this place is that there is no excuse for stale chips....or bad side dishes...\n\nSo first impression doesn't start well if you've been served stale chips.  YUCK!

I actually didn't mind these. The shrimp red sauce topping was fab (and I loved the shrimp) and the chicken was great.  It wasn't shredded, which I really hate getting in Mexi restaurants because I feel like they just take it out of a can.  Speaking of can, the side dish of Zucchini tasted like it was out of a can of Veggie Campbell's soup.  Really weird side dish.

{"text": "Food: Mexico City offers the standard fare food that you can expect to get at most Mexican places in the city, but everything seems to taste more authentic and true to actual Mexican food than the standard Americanized Mexican cuisine.  There are multiple versions of everything you'd expect like tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and fajitas, plus soups, stuffed peppers and other options if you're not looking for something stuffed in a tortilla.  There is a separate vegetarian section of the menu with 6-7 items, and most can be made vegan.  I've tried the stuffed poblano pepper, which I didn't think could be beat, until I tried the vegetarian burrito.  It is the best vegetarian burrito I have had in the city.  The same massive size as any other burrito, with twice the flavor.  But the real treat of Mexico City is the guacamole, which they make directly in front of you at your table.  You can have it made from mild to very spicy, and every iteration I've had is awesome.  And all meals come with unlimited chips/salsa.\n\nPrice: You can eat your fill for a very reasonable price at Mexico City.  Two entrees, a bowl of guacamole for two to share and tip comes to around $30.  The cocktails are fairly priced and there are always specials.  And don't forget great Happy Hour specials as well.\n\nDrinks: As I mentioned above, there are always specials, and they have plenty to beer and liquor to choose from.  The margaritas are huge and tasty, and they can be made with a myriad of tequilas.  \n\nAtmosphere: Unlike most of the Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, Mexico City celebrates and embraces Mexican culture.  Instead of Top 40 or indie music blasting through the dining room, Mexican music plays, and you may even walk into a salsa party.  There are small and large tables; the dining room is large and can accommodate groups of all sizes.  The bar is large too and has big TVs to follow the Steelers or Pens while downing a margarita.  The Wood St. location has one drawback, which is, of course, its location.  Parking is difficult, and you have to get lucky to get a spot on Wood St. anytime before 7PM.\n\nService: The staff has always been friendly, willing to answer questions and prompt with food and bill.  They will warn you if they are busy and the entree will be served prior to the guacamole, which is personally made at the table.  This doesn't negatively effect dinner at all, but its a nice courtesy to know ahead of time.  They refill your chips/salsa and water often.\n\n(+): authentic Mexican food for a great price, cheap and strong cocktails, friendly service\n\n(-): location\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm downtown, I go out of my way to walk to Mexico City for lunch, dinner, or Happy Hour.  Unfortunately, due to its location, I probably wouldn't drive downtown just to go unless I was really craving a big bowl of guac.", "user_id": "LFJglYRfXSdthKTcCg0qjw", "business_id": "9r4gq8LVewal0uTnLiS1zQ", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Truth be told, the options for Mexican food within the city of Pittsburgh are beyond what one would call limited. Aside from the chains like Qdoba, there really are only two that I can think of to choose from - Las Velas and Mexico City.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, they're both worth the time and tastebuds. Las Velas is more glitzy fancy, and Mexico City is more basic nitty gritty. One is location, location, location, with higher prices, and slightly better food, and one is off the beaten trendy path, with only slightly lower prices, and a much smaller menu. Although the much smaller menu seems to have developed some time in the last year.\n\nMexico City is a decent restaurant for standard Mexican fare, and although I do have to say that it seems to be on the downslide in patronage and atmosphere, the food is still the same good quality.\n\nWhen I went the first time a couple of years ago, the atmosphere was brighter, there were a few more occupied tables, the music was existent but not overbearing, there was a lot of staff running around keeping things going, and they were engaging.\n\nThis time around, the back half of the restaurant seemed to not even have the lights on, except for a few people at the bar we were the only other diners in the place, and there seemed to be one waitress, two guys going in and out of the kitchen, and one child of one of the staff, there was almost no noise except for the yinzer trailer park gal cackling at the bar, and the silenced television seemed stuck on the doom-and-gloom Hispanic news channel, which kind of looked like a long episode of 'Cops' on steroids.\n\nIt was 5:30 pm on a Friday, and there were no customers. \n\nWhich really was a shame, because the food was just as good as it had been, albeit sans a little of the extra 'glitz' that used to be attached.\n\nI ordered the Guacamole and chips to start us off. The menu had been pared down to a two-sided one-page deal, whereas it used to be several pages with more descriptions, but the Guacamole description even said 'prepared tableside'.  It wasn't prepared tableside, as it had been in the past, but it was still good when brought to the table. The chips were just right, light and crispy, without a heavy stale oily nature, and Guac, although it did seem a little skimpy on the ingredients, was still tasty, although a bit steep at $9 for a serving for 'four' which really only barely fed two.\n\nMy friend ordered enchiladas, and I ordered the 'Super Burrito' which is a large burrito stuffed with steak, rice and beans, cut in two, with two different sauces. The steak was very flavorful and tender, the burrito was very well stuffed, and they hadn't cut any corners on the sauces - they were still as good as they'd been under a more light atmosphere.\n\nThe bill, including tip, for the appetizer, two entrees and two sodas (Coke people, thank goodness!) was under $40, and we were full, and our tongues were not disappointed.\n\nIt always seems so sad to me to see downtown restaurants plain empty after work, and though I know the trend spots like Market Square will be filled, it makes me nuts that people here won't walk a block or two in a different direction to try something other than the trendy spots. Generally speaking from my experiences, the 'trendy' spots in da burgh usually end up being overpriced toy food.\n\nI'm not sure what I can say to boost the business of Mexico City. The atmosphere was very sad...but why liven it up for one table? Another couple did come in toward the end of our meal, but at 5:30 on a Friday, there should have been a hell of a lot more people there. The food is good...and that's what I go out to 'eat'. I don't chow down on atmosphere.\n\nBut hey - we had a good meal - in peace. No other pesky customers to annoy us.

An old head-high fence and hanging lamps with their illumination filtering through the wood beams.\n\nThe crowd is not what I call a traditional \"hipster\" crowd that you may encounter  a la Brillobox. More \"mature\" if that has any meaning nowadays. The front bar area was small, but never gave off the impression of sardine packed-in-ed-ness. What appealed to me the most is the general sociability of the place. They talk to strangers here, and while that may be tied to the people than the place, per se, it adds to it, imho.\n\nAll waitresses/servers are *amazingly* hot and friendly. Grabbed a seat. Drank two caipirinhas and a hopdevil. Packed full of kick. Mason jars, are strange to drink out of, unless you are from the south or Missouri.  I have no such problem, and it gives off a very down-to-earth air that I would expect out of Lawrenceville. Costs seem to be \"midling.\" 6-7 bucks for some of the drinks. That is not huge to me, but may be to others.\n\nMenu looked tasty, and had some Spanish and Mexican beers I ran into during my foreign travels.  Did not sample food menu, but will in the future. \n\nA great jukebox, and given the sensitivity of my ears, the volume was not too too bad...for a while. Later on that night, not sure if they cut it higher or if certain albums play louder than others. It seemed less of a problem than other places in terms of sheer \"blast.\"\n\nThere appears to be a secondary room of tables and chairs behind the front bar area, and going further to the rear of the establishment and up the hill is an intriguing grassy patio area. Did not explore that, because I'm a friendless wuss who is afraid of looking like a loser, but if you come with 5+ folk, you may want to snag a spot out there early and see what stars you may be able in amongst all the air pollution.\n\nThis is close to a 5, but I only gave 4 due to the slowness of getting served at times. It seems like there is no bar to serve clients on the rear-patio area; the two ladies in the front were very busy cranking out drinks for all, so I could not fault them for the time it took. The time was due to the crush, versus indicative of any rudeness or lack of attentiveness. If they could resolve that, or add more barstaff, I think it would tip it over into perfection.\n\nThis place has character, good service, good people, and thankfully is a work in progress.", "user_id": "NK4NVkePvLTSLysqKvKfRw", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 4}

A lot of the decor seems original, which is good, except for the huge hole in the floor under my bar stool.  The food was tasty and although the menu was short, they had a diverse selection with thoughtful flavor ideas.  I finished my meal without the bartender checking on me to see how things were or if I needed anything.  At the end I asked about taking my chips and bean dip home and the bartender informed me that they don't have take-out containers because they don't serve food to-go.  \"Sorryyyyyy\" she said as if I was supposed to throw my food away or put in in my pocket.  I ended up scooping the dip into foil and putting the chips in a bag.  I also made a suggestion to a woman with short hair next to me (seemed to be doing managerial things) that they should post their kitchen hours on their site since they differ from their operating hours.  She asked me \"WHY?\" in a snotty tone and I explained that since they don't answer their phone (their voicemail tells you to email them!?!) I was not sure if I would be able to eat.  I don't drink alcohol and my primary concern on Monday nights is checking out new restaurants.  Had I come down and their kitchen was not open I would be giving RCC even less stars.

{"text": "Went on Friday night for the first time with my partner and two friends.  It simply was slammed.  Front bar was full and surrounding handful of tables.  The back room, which has around 10 tables was also full.  There is no list and much less reservations.  This was very frustrating, jockeying for position to take a table when it opened up only to have the one person in front of you suddenly have their 8 friends show up and take all of the open tables.  We ended up waiting an hour for a table for four.\n\nNot much of a scene, it really didn't seem like a lawrenceville crowd at all... definitely mostly people from Shadyside or the burbs driving their BMWs down to the new hip spot.\n\nI must say though, once the food came, all my angst regarding seating and pretentious other customers melted away.  We started with guacomole and salsa, both of which were simply superb.  The guac was simple, but creamy and satisfying.  The salsa was full of roasted poblano goodness.\n\nThe menu is around 15 items from $5-$12.  The bulk of it are corn-tortilla tacos with various other offerings.\n\nThen my tacos came.  Good lord, I am so glad I ordered the pork belly.  Each taco had a healthy serving of pork belly covered in a spicy roasted, smoky sauce, onions, celantro, apple, radish and queso fresco.  I really wish I could eat these everyday.  At $8, the price was right for a sit down restaurant, but I do wish I could find these for lunch somewhere for $6.\n\nSo, all in all, the food and service was excellent.  The scene and having to jockey for a table for an hour really left me grumpy and will make me think twice about going again.\n\nLsatly, to the table of 3 who had finished their food when we got there, and were still at their table 2 hours later when we left.  If anyone from that group is reading this, what a low-life sitting there watching others wait for a table while you sip your drink and laugh about the wallpaper and run your hands through your stupid balding head of curly hair.  Go get a drink somewhere else and let people eat for god sake.\n\nNot good for groups I don't know what the heck previous reviewers are thinking.", "user_id": "Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 4}

The food is reminiscent of the ten years I spent in Southern California. No where else in this city will you get pork belly tacos and tamales that melt in your mouth. The ceviche is quite good, the guacamole rocks, and the brie and caramelized onion quesadilla is always a hit. Their margaritas are made with fresh juice, no gross mix! They're fantastic! \n\nCantina is not full of suburbanites or Shady-siders. it's a hip, cool, young, creative-class kind of scene, that isn't bothered by a crowded atmosphere. I've never once had a problem with the service, the bartenders are super friendly and fun. This place gets packed, so if you want a table in the back, get there early, or you will wait.

{"text": "Ok sure, the service isn't awesome on a Friday or Saturday night but the quality of the Mexican food here makes up for it!  Autentico!\n\nI'm a SoCal native and have been seeking decent tacos for SO long in the Burgh and of course they arrive as I am departing (shakes fist at sky in taco frustration!).  The pork belly as David mentions is fantastic.  I also really like the empanadas - flaky and meaty.  I think they make them with short ribs?  YUM.  A few times I've been there the corn tortillas for the tacos were a little thick but overall really delicious.  I'm a meat lover - and it's good here.  The carnitas are flavorful and moist but the chorizo sometimes is too salty.\n\nFriends T and P love the escabeche - the picked veggies and the micheladas -- beer with a kick!  There is one that is nice and spicy - they are on the beer menu not the drink menu.\n\nThe new and improved patio opened the first week of May.  It's awesome and at least three times as big as it was before.  It's currently near-summer in Pittsburgh which is a great time to go here to sit on the patio.  I went with a ton of friends on the opening weekend of the patio and it was crammed tight with fans but it's probably died down a bit since then.  I am armpit height on most normal humans so it was...odoriferous at times.  However everyone was friendly and having a great time.  I ran into more than one friend here (out separately) who texted the next day things like: \"so. bright. sun.\"  and \"did I see you last night? or was that a koala?\" - oh yeah, the drinks are strong.\n\nThe outside bar was only serving sangria (not bad!) and beer so you had to go inside for anything else or find a harried waitress in the throng.  One really nice touch was that they placed a BIG thermos cooler of ice water with cups on the patio so people could serve themselves - which probably saved me from a killer KILLER hangover.\n\nThe kitchen closes at midnight on Friday and Saturday so don't get carried away with your micheladas and forget to put in that last round of tacos!\n\nReally my rating is a 4 in the winter when you have to be a table vulture inside but a 5 in the summer when you can kick back on the patio.

The first time we tried, it was closed (think it was a Monday). The second time we tried, it was closed... don't remember what day it was - and not the fault of the restaurant really, just unfortunate. The third time we attempted, it was open and packed. We stood in the main waiting area for 15 minutes and not one person approached us... they just ignored us and walked on by. We decided to go across the street instead. We attempted a fourth time, and had the exact same experience as the third time. We decided that we were done with this place.\n\nLast night we were looking for a place to eat dinner, so we decided to give it one more chance. They were open, and had seating near the bar, and on the sidewalk in front of the building; however, you don't get table service out there - they will bring your food, but you have to go inside for everything else. I can deal with that, whatever. We got a few drinks while we were waiting for our food, and not only were they expensive, they were small, and they were not very good. They used a syrup to make it, and you could tell. Very disappointing considering how nice it was outside, and how cool the location is. It'd be a really great place to sit and have several drinks.\n\nSo our food came out. We had the Chorizo tacos and the fish tacos w/ some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually pretty good; however, the tacos were just terrible... and expensive. There was absolutely no flavor in fish tacos, and they were fried. No tasty sauces, and you couldn't even pick out the flavor of the cheese... it was just all very bland. As for the Chorizo tacos, they were a little better only because they had seasoning; however, the meat itself tasted off. We're still debating on if it was actually pork sausage, or fake meat flavored to taste like Chorizo - it said Mexican Pork Sausage on the menu. Needless to say, it was anti-food.\n\nThe worst part of all is that with 4 tacos, chips and salsa and two drinks, and tip the bill was Roughly $40!\n\nMy suggestion is to go to Mexico City for tacos/drinks. They have 2 locations downtown, and I think they just opened one in the South Side. I go there for lunch pretty often. Their tacos taste amazing, and are significantly cheaper and you get complimentary chips and salsa (and least the first round is complimentary).

Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry. \n\nOverall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back.

{"text": "I fell in love with Mexican tacos all over again.  \n\nHappy Hour 4:30-6:30 = half price tacos.  Awesome, nay, amazing Tacos. \nI lived in Mexico for 6 months.  I've had my fair share(OK, fine, more than my fair share) of Mexican street cart tacos.  I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.\n\nRCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they're served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They're serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they're blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I'd pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not \"authentic\" but it's still damned good.  I've given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*\n\nOn a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It's a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn't quite the same, but it still brought back memories.  \n\nOh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)\n\n*(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it's not on a spit, it doesn't have a pineapple at the top, and there isn't a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)", "user_id": "hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 5}

Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.\n\nNow, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\n\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\n\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston. Luckily, I can get re-aligned over the coming months! Pittsburgh pricing is rad. This place is rad. No smoking is rad.

The Tijuana Street Dog, a bacon wrapped hot dog slathered in all sorts of wonderment deserves a national holiday, but I save that for special occasions because I try to be nice to my arteries (sometimes). \n\nWhen I'm there for drinks I get a mojito or margarita. Margaritas lean towards the salty side but are also tangy and refreshing; great combo with Mexican food and served in boho-chic jars. Their tequila selection is so-so, I mean, I really expect more options if you're going to devote a fourth of your drink menu to a particular liquor. \n\nMake sure to bring out your best manners when ordering up at the bar, the bartenders can be a little rough around the edges at times.

Plus I thought the food is overall about average in my opinion.  I expected more from this place, especially after having read some of the glowing reviews on here.\n\nWent here for the first time about 6 or 7 months ago on a mini bar crawl of sorts and had a round of tequila shots with two friends.  I can't recall the tequila we had but it wasn't particularly tasty.  I think we paid $7 per shot, which was a bit higher than I was anticipating.  We all got kind of a cold vibe from the bartender and later discussed this fact amongst ourselves.  We payed for the shots and bounced within 5 minutes of being there.  About the interior - the indoor bar area was pretty dimly lit (it was around 9 or so from what I recall) and the small bar hangout area had a bunch of hipster-esque folks lingering about amongst themselves in little clusters.\n\nThe next time I went here was about 6 weeks ago with a larger group of friends.  I was really hoping to like this place on the second go-around, which was on a Tuesday evening for happy hour.  Their special is $4 margaritas and $4 sangrias, plus $1 off beers.  The margs were served in a mason jar, which sounds cool, but they are some TINY mason jars.  $4 seems maybe an average price for the serving size you get in my opinion.  And the quality of margarita was nothing particularly special either (I got mine on the rocks).  It just seemed bland, and not particularly strong.  I ordered a set of fish tacos (they were half off I believe?) as well, and they were decent but nothing special.  Nothing like what I remember sampling in coastal Baja California Sur (but then again I'm not sure what RCC is trying to emulate here).  Also got a Tijuana street dog which WAS in fact decent.  I mean it's tough to mess up a hot dog, and add some jalapenos, some avocado, bacon, crema, etc. and you've generally got yourself a party!  The chips were also decent and still warm, though I was not a huge fan of their salsa.  I'm tough to please with Mexican food.

It was also empty, so that is why I was able to actually order.  \n\nSo maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole, but we arrived at Round Corner around 7.  We were seated quick enough, however the waiting game had just started.  We weren't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10.  At least she returned with water for all.  She took our drink order and left without our food order.  \n\nThis is when I realized we were in trouble. At 7:45, she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again.  Yes, if you're doing the math, it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks.  All beer.\n\nShe returned around 8pm, by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round (to get a head start on that) and ordered our dinner.  That was the last we saw of her.  \n\nAfter another 15 minutes or so, my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress. Our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason.  My friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances.\n\nBy 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room.  At 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to Tamari never to return.", "user_id": "JNLqKOwVPk25IUbg7Hc8wA", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 1}

Ample cilantro and lime make them super tasty and radish adds nice color and crunch.

The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins).

{"text": "I've been to Round Corner twice, both times sitting in the fenced in patio in the back.  Once was a year ago and once was on a recent Saturday evening around 6:00pm.  The indoor seating is limited, but the outdoor seating area is one of the best in the Burgh.  \n\nIn 2009, the Round Corner Cantina was converted from the 28-year old Round Corner Hotel.  I never had the chance to visit the Round Corner Hotel, but from what I've heard it was a 28-year old dive bar that mainly catered to Lawrenceville locals.  Converting it to a Mexican bar was obviously a big change.  Although the Round Corner Cantina serves food, the focus is clearly on the drinks.  There's a variety of margaritas, beers, micheladas, and Mexican spirits.  Over the last year or so, the food offerings have decreased.  The only food options currently are chips and tacos.  The tacos have some creative ingredients like pork belly and house-made chorizo.  They're delicious.  On a sunny day, having a margarita and some tasty gourmet tacos at the Round Corner is a solid Yelp 4-star experience.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take away 2 stars for 2 major problems that I have with the Round Corner Cantina.  The first is that they allow smoking out on their patio.  If it's crowded and there's a lot of people smoking, the secondhand smoke is pretty bad.  What is this, 2000?  There's almost nothing I can stand worse than breathing in other people's cigarette smoke when I'm out in public.  I know the patio is outside, but it's also an enclosed space within the restaurant.  I'm not sure that's legal.  Either way, it's disgusting and really detracts from the nice experience of sitting outside.\n\nMy second criticism is how awfully slow the service is.  We were seated about 25 minutes before a server approached us.  Although there seemed to be a bunch of servers around, it was almost impossible for us to flag anyone down to get more drinks.  Finally, once our sever returned, she only took drink orders from the very end of our 8-person table and ran away before the rest of the table got to order.  Knowing the opportunity to order drinks was a few and far between occurrence, some of our group got up and ordered drinks from the outdoor bar (and returned before our drinks came from our server).\n\nThis kind of thing really shouldn't be happening at a restaurant  that's been open for 3 years.  Don't they want us to spend money at their establishment?  During our most recent visit, the Round Corner Cantina certainly lost out on some income because we couldn't find a server to take our orders.", "user_id": "dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I am a fan of Mexican food, good Mexican food. Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.\n\nWhen one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.\n\nIt is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.\n\nAs far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.\n\nHowever, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book.

{"text": "I keep forgetting that Lawrenceville is the new hipster hangout so I was somewhat unprepared for my Round Corner Cantina experience.  I met a friend around 9pm on a Thursday night thinking we would have no problem with crowds.  Big mistake.  After squeezing my car into the last open parking spot within a 5 block radius, we made our way inside.  The place was packed.  I was hoping to lounge outside, enjoy a few drinks and the lovely weather, catch up on current events....it was not to be.  Instead we settled for one of the last tables inside.\n\nThe service, while not the quickest, wasn't a complete disappointment considering how busy the place was.  The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had - which they should be for the price.  We also ordered tacos - my friend got the mahi mahi tacos, I the hanger steak tacos.  $7.50 for just two tacos seemed a little steep, but they were darn good.  The beer and cocktail menu has lots of options.  One of our biggest likes was the music - lots of great songs I hadn't heard in awhile.\n\nI don't know that I was necessarily impressed with my whole Round Corner Cantina adventure, but I will probably be back.

{"text": "I hate writing a critical review of Round Corner because I love the vibe of the place, and the drinks are actually really good. Plus, the owner is a nice guy. Unfortunately, the food just doesn't do it for me, and that's the most important aspect.\n\nOf all of the things that I've tried in the handful of times that I've eaten there, I'd say the tamales are the best thing on the menu. They're truly delicious, and the sole thing that I think about when Round Corner is mentioned. The pico and chips are also good. The pico has a real freshness about it, but that's hardly a unique thing to pull off. \n\nThe part that keeps my review of Round Corner from being a totally positive one is the tacos. The first area where the tacos fail - quite literally - is the corn tortillas. I'm impartial on their use of corn over flour tortillas, but the fact that the they use TWO tortillas for each taco and they STILL fall apart almost immediately when you try to pick up your taco is ridiculous. The flavors in the tacos are fairly pedestrian and almost monotonous, but I can't stand being required to use a fork to eat a taco. On the plus side, they're fairly affordable (2 tacos for about $7), but if taco stand/truck-quality tacos are what you're craving you can still enjoy tastier tacos for less from one of those options.\n\nWill I go back? Sure. My complaints aren't deal breakers, by any means, but Round Corner is hardly my first choice when I'm in a taco/mexican food kind of mood.", "user_id": "sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 3}

The menu changes unfortunately have not been for the better. Their once eclectic selection which featured dishes like a cheesy au-gratin served in a cast-iron skillet, is now a page of run-of-the-mill mexican fare.

I had the seitan tacos, which I'd recommend as a decent veg option. \n\nOn the plus side, their guacamole is top-notch and they have a bomb patio. I highly recommend their chips, guac, and margaritas or sangria if you're looking to kick it with friends.

Both well-mixed and priced right.  Not too crowded.\n\nThe catch is that this place is intolerable on weekends.  Being that Butler St. only has a dozen bars, this should be a top choice for me.  But it's not.  The service is incredibly slow.  Worst than that, the server knew nothing about the drinks.  I tried to ask about the Carnation, but she had to look at the menu to see which drink I was referring to.  I ordered it anyway.  What looked to be a mix of the best attributes of my two favorite cocktails--the Cosmo and the Dark 'N Stormy--was just a heavy dose of ginger beer with a splash of mediocre vodka, a touch of cran juice, far too much lime, and way too much ice.  It was a hot night and the drink was thoroughly watered down by the time it got to me.  I'd be inclined to blame the server over the bartender, but I'm not sure.  I'm not a professional bartender, but when I serve drinks with ice on days over 80 degrees, I make specialty ice cubes with the drink ingredients to not water down the drink.  For $7, I certainly wasn't expecting my cocktail to be a third water by the time it arrived.\n\nFinally, the food.  In a word: eh.  I thought both of the pork tacos were all right.  But the pollo tinga was downright awful.  Chicken in all varieties is one of my food staples, but something unholy was done to this poultry.  The guac was decent, but honestly Mad Mex has better...and if you're claiming to be authentic Mexican anything, Mad Mex should not best you on any detail.  To top it off, they charge $3.5 for chips and salsa and then only refill the chips but not the salsa.

Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos.

The apple salsa and the poblano made it just spot-on delicious! I've also tried the chips with salsa and their guacamole. I would recommend the guac over the salsa. The salsa wasn't bad, but it was sort of average. The guac was nice and creamy with bits of cilantro (I love cilantro).\n\nOn to the alcohol: the selection is small and Mexican, which is fine with me because I love my Tecate and Dos Equis Amber (small and Mexican - NO PUN INTENDED hehe). \n\nOne of the things I love about this place is the price is right.

{"text": "What can I possible say about Round Corner Cantina that hasn't been said already? Guess we will see!\nI love tacos, so obviously a place that serves nothing but tacos, and tacos done right, is very appealing to me. The outside of the building is really cute, quintessential Lawrenceville, and it literally has a rounded corner. Thanks, Captain Obvious! From the outside of this brick building, you'd never guess they had quite the substantial outdoor courtyard that they do, but on a warm day it's an ideal place to sit and enjoy one of those margaritas. The La Cantina margarita is outstanding, there doesn't seem to be a reason to order anything else (although there are many spirit options!),  and there's just something comforting about drinking tequila from a mason jar. Maybe it's me. \nThe guacamole is really fantastic and fresh, and you get a huge portion of it for $5. The chips are a bit on the greasy side, but it's obvious they are made fresh daily, and usually by this point I'm down half a margarita at least and don't care quite as much. The chunky pico de gallo is really quite good as well. \nThere are two vegetarian options on the taco menu, the tacos de seitan and the tacos de rajas con papas. The latter have poblano peppers, cooked potatoes, corn, the fantastic chihuahua cheese, cilantro, and RADISHES. I can't stress how much I enjoy radishes on my tacos. I had no idea I was missing this from my life/taco repertoire until I visited Round Corner Cantina. The seitan tacos also have radishes(!), a refreshing avocado salsa, stewed onions, and the seitan is prepared in this spicy-ish sauce that I could put on my cereal. I've never had seitan prepared so expertly. Even if you aren't a vegetarian, you owe it to yourself to try these tasty little numbers.\nThe service has always been decent, kind of slow, but not terrible. Also, if you had never been here before, you'd walk in and just think this place was a small bar. You have to walk past the bar and around a corner to find the dining room and patio, it looks like you are heading to the bathroom, it isn't obvious. The plate size that the tacos come on I also find to be a bit curious, as it is barely big enough for the two tacos that come with your order, which makes things a bit messy. But maybe that's just me. None of these things could ever stop me from craving that seitan taco.

{"text": "I came here on a Monday night at the recommendation of the Patio edition of the Yelp newsletter. When I walked in, I felt like I was walking into one of those old-time, dusty, quiet bars in the southwest, which isn't a bad thing. It was dark and had a dive-bar vibe, but a bit cleaner. We went straight out to the patio in the back and I was very pleased with the bright Mexican decor, lights and decorative high top tables. We took a seat, ordered an array of margaritas and beers and stayed for a few hours. The drink prices are decent for what you get, they had half price tacos, and great chips and salsa. It definitely doesn't break the bank! My favorite drink of the night was the El Rey margarita which has some chile de arbol in it, which gave it a spicy kick. I also had the La Chiquita Sarita which was a strawberry margarita on the rocks with muddled lime, but way more unique than it sounds. It was a close second to the El Rey for me. Try the Micheladas for a beer/margarita hybrid beverage. The only thing that bumped a star down for me was the service.

{"text": "OMG, the happy hour actually is happy!\n\nAs if you couldn't tell this was my first visit here.  And what better of a time to go than happy hour on a Friday?  Drink specials and free chips and salsa!  The pitcher of margaritas is a great buy during this time compared to the price per glass.  \n\nLet me go back to the beginning.  When we walked in we were greeted by the doorman who promptly asked for ID (thank you, I feel young again!).  The door did state that NO ONE under the age of 21 is allowed entry.  The lighting was dim, the room cozy with a sign pointing to the patio (watch the steps), and the aroma upon entry was amazing.  Fresh mint everywhere!  Made me want a mojito, but I stuck to my guns and had a margarita.\n\nThe patio area is amazing and huge.  Self seating so you can find your own spot that you think will be the best for your dining experience (note, the patio is smoker friendly, which is rare to find a place that is friendly to their smokers).  The thing I liked most was that after the first delivery of water, you are free to go and refill your own glass, not saying that I did, but honestly with as busy as they were, you didn't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to come by for a refill.  As stated before, I had my pitcher of margaritas and my friend opted for a pitcher of XX Amber.  Both at happy hour prices are a great buy and also a great thing to help pass the time.  \n\nWe didn't just come here for the libations, but for the food as well.  I had the potato rolled tacos and my friend opted for chile relleno.  Both looked good but I can only tell you how mine was.  Four rolled and fried tacos filled with potatoes, for an Irish boy like me that has a huge love for Mexican food I was in heaven.  The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole.  I'm not talking about those tiny dollops you get from a fast food chain.  This amount stretched across the four tacos and was a thick line of goodness.  But that shouldn't overshadow the chipotle sauce or queso fresco that also topped the tacos.  A serving of fresh pico was also on the plate, but off to the side so you could scoop as much or as little on top of it all.  The most amazing/surprising thing on the plate was the fried rice.  This is not your typical fried rice.  Think Chinese with a twist.  The rice had the typical corn, peas, and carrots in it.  But I also came across small pieces of potatoes and chicken and I'm sure there were other items in there, but I was too busy mixing everything on my plate at this point.  \n\nThe prices are a bit steep here, but don't let that deter you, it's well worth it.  To say that I will be back here is an understatement.  I think this may be my new favorite Mexican place in the city.  I'm so hungry for it now that I have written this review.", "user_id": "UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 5}

Now, I've been a cocktail server so I'm usually pretty understanding about service issues...I'm willing to give Cantina staff the benefit of the doubt that they're just chronically understaffed and not that the servers are doing a poor job. But it really shouldn't take that long to put in a drink order and, unless its a busy night, making customers get their own water (from a warm jug in the back) isn't exactly a nice touch. Also, the food here is pretty terrible. Possibly some of the worst \"Mexican\" I've had in the city. Finally, while the outdoor area is nice, the back room in the indoor area is kind of depressing. Very poorly lit and bare (and not in a cool, dark dive bar way).\n\nIn spite of this review, I will probably keep coming here.

{"text": "I wanted to like Round Corner Cantina. I really did. But I have to say, after my first visit here I'm not dying to come back.\n\nBefore you even enter this place you have to deal with something that isn't really their fault: parking. And navigating traffic. On Butler Street. Always a joy! Once I managed to deal with this step and actually entered Cantina I wasn't really encouraged; the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and wasn't much better in their back room, which was so dark I had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there. \n\nLooking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter, my dinner companion and I headed to their outdoor patio, where we found high tables and chairs that I honestly thought I'd fall off of at some point during the meal, they were so unsteady. Fortunately that never happened, because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered - just thinking about tipping into them was painful!\n\nUnfortunately, the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place; I watched three tables that arrived after us get service. No one ever came to our table. After we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over, she said she'd grab our waitress. And we waited some more. While we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water...that came in plastic cups. I shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone...\n\nAfter finally ordering and waiting for what at least wasn't an unreasonable amount of time, I was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar (they have jars for alcohol but not for your water?) but was disappointed with my pork tacos. The shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal; mine just didn't taste all that special. My dinner companion's fish tacos were actually better; I kind of wish we'd swapped.\n\nI left just feeling let down. I honestly would've been happy to forgive this place's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better, but as it is I just don't see anything here that I'd want to brave the dreaded Butler street traffic again for.", "user_id": "DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 2}

Don't ask me why, but we were as enthralled as Harry Potter on his first day at Hogwarts.\n\nI had just thru 18 weeks of chemo and I actually felt like Mexican food. Like eating it, that is.   My husband thought another trip to R.C.C. was in order so off we went, as jolly as Spongebob and Patrick on their way to see Sandy Bottom.\n\nOur waitress was as nice as she could b, but nothing could have lifted our spirits after our foray into the \"Choose Three Dips\" special.  We had spicy salsa, pico de gallo,  and a thin avocado dip that was a beautiful shade of mint but seriously lacking in taste and texture.\n\nNo complaints from my hubby re. the pork tacos but he was so tired , he could barely speak. Towards the end of his meal,  all he said was , \" I'm not going to complain, we just won't go back.\". He never complains about his meal; he just vows never to return and unfortunately no one remembers that  he was there in the first place. He ordered a side of black beans, too, but alas, the salt must've murdered the chef then invited all his friends to go swimming in my husband's pathetic little appetizer.\n\nMy meal consisted of 3-4 potato flautas.  The menu stated that the flautas were filled with potatoes.  First of all, each flauta was so overly deep fried  and hard to chew I forgot about the potatoes.  When I realized there were no potatoes, I simultaneously realized there were potatoes: about three shreds per flauta and and so overly fried they appeared to b a part of the corn tortillas.\n\nIf ur under 40 and enjoy partying outside on a restaurant patio, this place does have beer and liquor.

When our party of six went for a late dinner (9pm) it was one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. \n\nWe wanted to eat on the patio, which we quickly figured out was 'seat yourself'. This is where it turned into The Hunger Games. Everyone standing around hawkishly waiting for a table. You make some friends and alliances to get the job done, survive and get a table. While we waited in the middle of this half open air Thunderdome I made my way to the bar to grab a libation. This might be how they keep you busy. The seemingly infinitely patient couple in front of me and I waited for a solid ten minutes before...well whatever the hell was going on was situated and we were asked for our order. Just to stretch my legs, another 5 minutes for 2 sangria, which I will say that both the red and the white are fantastic. I digress. \n\nWe finally won the pity of a family from District 1 who made sure to tell us they were leaving to show their commitment to bestow upon us they're semi-primo series of three small tables pushed together saving us from having to shoulder block the 2 middle aged woman to my right from swooping in to protect the Cornucopia. Tables. \n\nThen the hunt for 2 more chairs was on. This is the point in the final few minutes of \"The Games\" where you expect all the kids to turn on each other. We made enemies. We made friends. You never know how good a person really is till times are dire and you need their help. Our party was complete. Pressed in together snugly on three sides of the tables haphazardly pressed up against the rail (one of the long sides mind you) while the \"DON'T MOVE THE FURNITURE\" sign daunted overhead. \n\nWe've sat. We've ordered. War is hell. Really enjoyed that first half hour. \n\nNow I'm excited.

Maybe the fight is part of the experience Makes you tougher. Makes you hard.

Apparently caring about ones appearance is a crime warranting death in Hipsterville. I mean the people there stared at us as if they had a vested interest in the clothing we wore. I'm sorry that I didn't fit into the standards of pseudo-individualism that the Nazi hipsters have clearly tried so hard to establish throughout the neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, once we got around the pack of scowling hipsters standing in the front doorway (with their standard large black-rimmed glasses, unkempt hair, and rolled trousers) we made our way through the nearly pitch-black front room and to the open back patio. We stood for a minute or two feeling the palpable hatred of almost all of the other patrons (and some staff members) weighing down on us. We finally figured out that we would have to seat ourselves after several staff members pushed their way past us to get to the doorway. I have no problem seating myself, but I didn't expect to have to bring my own chair to the table. When my two heel-clad friends were finally able to pull up five chairs (while the rest of us viciously protected an empty table) we sat down to wait for a server. About 20 minutes after we entered the place someone finally addressed our group. Our first waitress threw down the menus and walked away without even offering to bring us water. It was hot so we flagged down another waitress and asked her for water, because the small water dispensers at the back of the patio were empty. We sat for another 15 minutes and the second server finally brought us water and took drink and food orders. After another 40 minutes we received our food, but the drinks came about 10 minutes later.

Another friend got the Chorizo Scramble, which was almost void of potatoes although the menu clearly listed potatoes as a main ingredient. One of my friends got a virgin version of a beverage and was charged the same amount as the alcoholic version, but she didn't bother complaining. All in all the food was okay, but I've had better for less. The stares and AWFUL service had us wanting to run out of the place ASAP.

{"text": "Cantina! I LOVE this place!\n\nThe patio is amazing. They updated it a few years ago and it is incredible now. The front bar also has a really cool vibe to it, and the back room is good for large groups and dinner.\n\nThe food here is really actually very good! I used to just come here for drinks, but the brunch menu is to die for, and the dinner and late-night food is notable as well. Very vego friendly, with veggie taco options and other snacks and sides, all which are worth trying at some point. The red salsa that comes with chips is super sweet and spicy, but the guacamole is my favourite to go with a meal or as a snack. For a while there, my friends and I were Cantina guac addicts.\n\nThe drinks are cheap, especially for a place with as nice an atmosphere as Cantina. The margarita menu has everything you could ever dream of at a Mexican bar, and I've tried them all. The El Camino and the strawberry one are my favourite. The beers are also cheap, with lots of local and Mexican selections available. They have micheladas, too, but I have yet to try them because I can't seem to stop ordering margaritas here even when I try to tell myself to order something new.\n\nThursday karaoke night is worth checking out. You don't have to sing, just go and enjoy it. There are mad drink specials that night, too.", "user_id": "EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 5}

Seating is hard to find if you go during a busy time, and you feel like more of a hassle or burden to the people than a customer.\n\nRegardless, I love tacos. I crave them at all hours of the day.  Especially fish tacos, and this place has my favorite fish tacos in Pittsburgh.  We usually order fish, shrimp and chorizo.  Made the mistake of ordering the chicken tacos recently and I will never make that mistake again.\n\nI'm personally not a huge fan of their confusing extensive drink menu filled with things Ive never heard of before, and the corona last time we went was canned and room temperature.  No bueno.

Each star down usually involves some sacrifice in these areas, with one star being bad at both. This is the first time I'm writing a review that is one star entirely because of service, because the food itself isn't bad. But the service was awful to the point that it is worth my time to warn people away after my experience there this event. I went in with a few friends for some drinks and snacks at the bar. I'm not sure what his problem was but the bartender was a complete jerk. Service was slow for us food wise and that normally isn't an issue but someone tending bar should be friendly and accommodating not snappy and rude for no reason. We weren't the only ones with an issue, as the bartender decided to yell across the restaurant at another party, making rude remarks about a patron and ordering her to leave. It was like being transported into the soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and completely shocked us. This place must be doing great if they can afford to have an employee ordering clearly sober and not disorderly customers to leave and put off other customers in the process. It's rare to see a place throw money away like that but after seeing how that lady was treated and after the attitude my group got, they won't be having me back even if their food isn't bad. I can cook at home, I go out to eat for the experience and the service, and Cantina proved that they don't need customers or don't want them, I'm not sure which. I won't be recommending then to anyone now, and after putting on this type of display, I doubt I'm the only person who was put off.", "user_id": "CG5IC65feFk0jvPgqVnImQ", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 1}

The chips seem to be made in house so that is a plus. \nI absolutely love the Elotes, which is sweet corn with Queso fresco on top. I would give the corn 5 stars. I haven't found any other restaurant that makes the sweet corn as good. \nFor the tacos I've ordered the mahi mahi & the potato cauliflower. The mahi mahi is good. But not a fan of the cauliflower. I thought it was kind of dry & lacked some flavor. \nAlso the set up is kinda of strange. There's no hostess when you walk in so you seat yourself, the seating area is kind of small & it can be hard to get a table. And on nights when they are busy it can get tricky to figure out who's waiting for a table & who's been in line the longest without there being a hostess to keep track.

I wanted to try someplace I have never been and it was a gorgeous day, so we decided to check out Round the Corner Cantina =]. The back patio is what brought us in- we arrived rather early, around 5:20pm and the back patio was already packed. We were able to squeeze in on the end of another party's table. \n\nI ordered the elotes (sweet corn on the cob with cheese and spices) to start. WOW. This was honestly some of the best corn I have ever had. The flavor was amazing and it was such a unique dish! $5 for one single corn on the cob though, was a little steep. My sister ordered a cheese quesadilla. I have had corn tortillas in the past, but these were the thickest I have ever had. My sister hated the quesadilla- and I could see why. It was difficult to eat and wasn't very cheesy at all. She was able to eat one of the quesadillas and I took the others home in an attempt to eat them later. I ended up throwing them away because the flavor just wasn't there. I ordered the pollo pibil tacos (roasted chicken). They were a little spicy, but the avocado salsa and pickled red onions cooled it down nicely. They weren't bad- but were nothing super impressive or memorable at all. The tortilla also didn't bother me as much in the tacos as it did in the quesadillas. We also shared an order of fried rice, which was good. I did need to add hot sauce for additional flavor though. Since we came during happy hour, our chips and salsa were free- saving us about $4-5. The salsa was very watery (as a lot of homemade salsas are) but very good. It had a slight kick to it, which I loved. The chips were clearly made in house and were sprinkled in sea salt and were pretty good. We also ordered a grilled green onion as well, which was literally a grilled green onion with oil, pepper and salt. It was also pretty good and gave me a new idea for summer grilling! Our server was very friendly and accommodating to my sister and I. He was busy but remained attentive to our table the entire time =].\n\nMy overall rating would be 2.5 stars but I rounded up.

I had really REALLY high expectations for this place, and while I wouldn't say I was let down, there were a couple things that didn't quite sit right with me, ergo my 3 star rating. \n\nFirst, I called earlier this evening to ask a quick question, and not only did no one answer, but their voicemail was full.. not ok for a business in my opinion. Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind.  \n\nFrom that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast. We got the queso as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Seriously the best queso I've ever had anywhere. So good! I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.  \n\nBy the time we left, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it and we'll be going back soon I'm sure.

{"text": "I visited Round Corner Cantina with my cousin last Sat.  We were looking for a place to have dinner, so I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards.  Based on the options available, my cousin and I both decided on Round Corner, so we headed over to Lawrenceville to check it out.\n\nAt the time of our visit, it had just finished raining, so almost all of the tables on the patio were empty.  We decided to hedge our bets by sitting at the outdoor bar, which had partly covered seats.  Fortunately, it didn't rain any more, and the rest of the tables on the patio filled up during the time of our visit.  To get to the patio, when you walk in the front door, proceed to the doorway at the far end of the bar and you'll see another doorway leading to it right after that (this wasn't clear to us upon first entering!).  I highly recommend sitting on the patio if possible, since it's quite nice, whereas the indoor rooms are dark and stuffy.\n\nOnce seated, we started off by ordering chips and guacamole ($7), which came out in about 5 min.  The chips were underseasoned and had a bit of a waxy texture, and the dip was fresh (containing avocado chunks) but wasn't super flavorful.  Nevertheless, they served their purpose as an appetizer by giving us something to munch on while awaiting the rest of our order.  This was a good thing, since the rest of our order took 30 min. to come out, which the bartender said was due to the printer in the kitchen breaking.\n\nFor our entrees, my cousin ordered the pescado (fish) tacos ($9), and I ordered the carnitas (pork) tacos ($9).  We each exchanged a taco with one another so that we could both try both different types of tacos.  I found the tacos mediocre in flavor and composition, esp. for the price.  The fish was the better of the two--the shell of the pork taco fell apart while I ate it due to grease, and the meat was a bit chewy.  We also ordered the elote (Mexican street corn; $5) as a side item. This was by far the best part of the meal--the cotija cheese topping was quite delicious.  Even so, the corn was a bit mushy, which detracted from the overall effect.\n\nOverall, I was less than impressed with the quality of the food at Round Corner, esp. for the price (fortunately, we didn't pay full price thanks to the City Dining Card).  And, needless to say, I wasn't exactly pleased with having to wait so long for the main order, esp. after the initial order was fulfilled so quickly.  However, the patio provides a nice environment, and our service from the bartender was good, notwithstanding the kitchen delay.  If you're looking for great traditional tacos, I suggest Las Palmas in Oakland or Edgar's in the Strip, and if you're looking for delicious upscale tacos, I recommend Tako downtown.  In general, I'd suggest sticking to drinks and apps at Round Corner, and giving most of the food a pass.  2.5 stars.", "user_id": "9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 2}

{"text": "We came to this place on a Monday due to a friend's recommendation that their Monday special is $5 tacos. Excited at the thought of enjoying semi-authentic Mexican tacos for $5 a pair, I knew I had to come check out this deal. After all, having closed for a few months due to liquor license issues, this place may offer new thrills and flair that didn't exist before. Our group was immediately able to find seats in the outdoor patio, thinking we were lucky that the other people of Lawrenceville were not taking advantage of this deal. We were served by a petite brunette waitress with curly hair wrapped in a bun. She went over the drink special and proceeded to take our drink order, all business without a smile (which is fine). Since we were a large group, we ordered a decent amount, and then each of us ordered 1-2 orders of tacos each, salivating at the thought of $5 tacos.\n\nOur tacos eventually came out, which came in pairs and were okay in quality. I'll never complain about $5 tacos though. We eventually got the check but were confused why all of our tacos except for 4 were listed at full price. After notifying the waitress, she gives us an empty stare and then says that only 3 of the listed tacos are $5. Mind you, the menu has no mention of any of their specials and does not explicitly say that only certain tacos are $5 during their Monday special. She then goes to grab the manager (or at least someone who claims he's the manager; he actually bartends at the front bar), who comes to our table and apologizes on the waitress's behalf by saying that the waitress is correct and that she clearly told us about the taco special's specifications. According to him, the only reason why all 7 of us magically did not hear her mention anything about the taco special was because we were all talking when she was going over them. To top it all off, he justified it by saying that she's one of their best servers (love high standards) so he has to go by her word. After all, the customer is always WRONG.\n\nAstonished and appalled that the manager was blaming us, we proceeded to insist that the waitress never mentioned anything and that a restaurant menu should have explicit information saying so. He then says that the sign outside the restaurant, which happens to point towards a side street away from the main entrance, clearly states the details of this special.

{"text": "This is my first Yelp comment. I usually don't have a strong opinion about things.  I've never in my life asked to speak to a manager about something negative.  It would take something pretty major for me to share my thoughts on the web.  But dinner tonight really pushed me over the edge.\n\nLong story short, we went to Round Corner Cantina for their $5 Monday night taco special, ordered a bunch of $5 tacos, and then got our check which showed many of our tacos were $9 or $10.  We figured it was a mistake, so we kindly waited until we got the attention of our waitress and let her know.  She, with the same blank stare and flat affect she displayed throughout the night, told us only 3 of the tacos on the menu were on the $5 special.  We were surprised to hear this and told her there was no indication on the menu about which were on special, and she had never mentioned to us that only some were on special.  She seemed disinterested from the start of the conversation and deflected our questions to the manager.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the manager came by and we told him what the confusion was.  At first, we had hoped to talk to him to try to explain the confusion and if anything, help them make it clear to future customers who were also unaware.  But his response to our concerns completely changed everything (hence why I'm writing my first Yelp comment).  His first words were \"She (the waitress) told you guys when you got here about the special, but she said you were talking to one another and didn't hear her.\"  WHAT??? ARE YOU SERIOUS DUDE?? The manager of this restaurant seriously just blamed us for talking to one another (I don't know what you rest of you folks out there do at restaurants) and not listening when our disinterested waitress supposedly explained things to us.  Even if she did tell us these things (which I'm pretty confident she didn't), wouldn't she have tried to get our attention?  Talking to the back of peoples' heads seems counterproductive.\n\nWhen we voiced that none of us could recall this, he responded, \"Well I have to take her word because she's one of the best servers\" (God Bless America) and he couldn't do anything to help us.  Is this guy serious? He's going to tell a large party of customers that their lack of attention to his lackluster, eye-rolling (again, I'm not the type to normally care about these things) waitress is their problem and that they should essentially deal with it. Wow. Just wow.  I know we all have good days and bad days.  I've had bad days where I'd probably come across as lackluster and flat, but I would never take my own misdoings and blame it on the customers who support my business' success.\n\nI'll never go back to Round Corner. I'm honestly upset about that because I thought the food was pretty decent, especially for [what I thought was] $5.  There are just some things in life you don't do and this was one of them.  I hope all of you reading out there have better experiences, because nobody deserves a pleasant night out with friends to be tarnished by a manager who is too weak to own up to his own mistake.", "user_id": "VaIKU-wqOV40ng7p6eWqYw", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 1}

We started, of course, with Bloody Marias while looking over the menu--they're on special for $4 during brunch hours, which is a great deal. \n\nI eventually settled on the Brisket Hash. I love savory breakfasts and this seemed like a solid choice. The dish consisted of soft, salty potatoes topped with tender and flavorful brisket, bacon, a fried egg, onions, and cilantro. I added a dash of hot sauce for some spice, but overall the dish was packed with flavor. The portion size was perfect for the price ($9) and left me satisfied but not uncomfortably full as brunches so often do. \n\nI've always been happy with the drinks here, and now that I've enjoyed the brunch, I need to make it back to try the regular menu sometime soon.", "user_id": "4tzuxIVry4xkOR9vbpgjrw", "business_id": "zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw", "stars": 4}

I had 2 cheese chile rellenos, which most restaurants cover with red enchilada sauce.  Here, they were covered with diced tomatoes, pineapple, and something else - green olives, maybe.  The breading was a little thick and tended to overpower the flavor of the chile.  The chiles could have used a bit more cheese.  On the side, instead of rice and beans, these come with rice and steamed baby carrots and broccoli.  I thought the veggies could have used a little more time in the steamer.\n\nOverall, I felt like they were trying to make a healthier twist on chiles rellenos, which is nice, but I kind of like them covered in sauce and oozing cheese.\n\nOther minor gripes: they were out of plain Pepsi - only diet and Mountain Dew.

{"text": "Over ten years in PGH, the only real Mexican food outside of Texas, or the southwest I've had are the Las Palmas street tacos. My daughter was in the mood for a meat dish so we agreed on Cocina Mendoza. (This was my first trip to a Mexican restaurant in sw PA).\n     We picked a booth with two very cool, and familiar pictures of Pancho Villa staring at us. The chips, and salsa were good, not pico de gallo salsa, but a nice tomato saucy blend of cilantro, maybe a splash of lime, and very little seasoning. The chips were warm, unsalted, and nicely crunchy. I honestly would've been happy eating chips, and salsa while my daughter ate her beef fajitas. \n     I ordered Combination plate 11, cheese chile relleno, one chicken enchilada, and one beef enchilada with rice, and refried beans. It's been a few years since I've had a good chile relleno, and Mendozas was okay. The charred poblano pepper was about the size of my hand, (5 inches long), and filled with queso fresco, dipped in egg white, and fried. My first time having a chile like this. The shredded chicken enchilada, and the ground beef enchiladas were good enough to stifle my cravings until our summer trip south. The Mexican rice, and refried beans were comfort food on their own level. My daughter picked Mendozas fajitas over Emilianos since she's had both to compare.\n     Some might describe the food being bland, but I would guess a lot of ethnic food establishments are trying to not scare off those with sensitive taste buds. Fortunately, Cocina Mendoza provides salt, pepper, and Tapatio hot sauce at the table, don't hesitate to use them!\n     The decor was inviting, very traditional Mexican restaurant style, and our server was friendly, maybe shy. I'd go back to Cocina Mendoza, it hit the right spot, and was worth braving a gray, cold January day.", "user_id": "WcDdWdsxmOYPxtbRRr1IaA", "business_id": "NJcLaATrb0Y6Cq3sDHhASw", "stars": 4}

A relleno, a steak burrito, a chicken fajita, a beef taco, all with a side of refried beans and Mexican rice. \n\nThe relleno was done well, with the cheese inside being a great consistency. Adding some of the beans and rice to a forkful, and this thing was fantastic. The steak burrito was sizeable, and filled with a decent amount of steak, rice, and other fixings. Sour cream worked really well with it. The chicken fajita was great, with the chicken being seasoned well and the onions and peppers adding a perfect mix of flavor. The beef taco was the only lackluster-y part of the meal, but how do you really compare a hard-shell taco to the rest of the above? The beef was seasoned well and the cheese on top was good.

My date ordered the 'Enchiladas De La Abuela', which I imagine is a vegetarian dish despite the description since there was little to no meat to be found in them. The sauce covering them tasted like chili powder, flour, and water... end of list. It was completely bland and lacked any discerning flavor. I ordered the 'Mar y tierra OK maguey'. They rolled it out on a cart and lit the skewers on fire in an attempt to add a little flare to the evening. The fire must have burnt any spec of flavor that may have been on them because I surely didn't taste any. The shrimp tasted like they had been marinated in sea water overnight before being boiled in a saline solution and served to me. The steak tasted like a vampire had gotten to the cow before slaughter. Every ounce of flavor had been drained out of it somehow and replaced with the heavy taste of salt. Salt I'm they got from the shrimp's marinade. Baby birds eat better meals than the one I had last night. If the place burned down, the ashes would taste better than the garbage I was served. And to add insult to injury, the bill was ridiculously high, an automatic 15% gratuity had been added, and we were forced to pay for drinks that the server dropped off without either of us ordering them.

On the first trip the bartender was friendly enough but still not really attentive. He never once asked if I'd like another drink or if I liked the drinks he made me.\n\nI hate saying this so often in my reviews, but I've also been around and been undeniably ME long enough to know that my appearance isn't always what restaurants are used to or wanting in their establishment. It's not uncommon for me to get a cold shoulder in my ratty ragtag stitched up, patched over hoodie. It sucks but it's true, and often it dictates my service. \n\nThis second time though was almost unreal. It was Light Up night so I know this could have had something to do with it, if it hadn't been for the previous happy hour's issues.  I showed up prior to the crowds. Ambled over to the bar and while standing there about to take off my messenger bag and I was nearly knocked over by what I assume was a waiter there, or a host who seats people. I turned to see who had almost plowed me over and he turned at the same time and just stared at me. No \"excuse me\" or \"I'm sorry.\" Nothing.\n\nI sat down at the bar and it was at least 10 minutes before the bartender stopped talking to the female bartender and other staff. When he finally came over the conversation went like this...\n\nMe: \"It's not happy hour yet, huh?\"\nBartender: \"Nope not until 5pm.\"\n\nThat would imply it would be happy hour at 5pm, right? Am I crazy? No signs saying it's not going to be happy hour on Light Up Night, nothing from the bartender about it. Nothing.\n\nAfter two drinks that I literally had to WORK to get from the bartender. My friend, my sister, and I wanted to sit down at a table. Our friend was riding her bike over from her job in the strip. I went to the hostess to get a table. I was told they couldn't seat us at any of the 10 + empty tables until our friend got there. I realize this is commonplace at a lot of restaurants, but it was off putting none the less since 3 people can't be seated at a 2 person table so the only other option was A TABLE THAT SEATS FOUR PEOPLE. Geeze Louise. \n\nSo besides not ever being seated, not ever having eye contact made with me, prompt or friendly service, or a chance to try the food...

{"text": "I'm kind of split down the middle when it comes to Las Velas' food.  I've visited twice now since they re-opened and I've had both very good food and food that left much to be desired.  \n\nI give two thumbs up for appetizers and desserts.  Their chips and queso are muy yummy.  The chips are a bit thicker than your standard tortilla chip so it stands up to the cheese better, which is really delicious with tomatoes and cilantro mixed in.  I also had a really refreshingly sweet dessert with fried pita chips and vanilla ice cream covered with honey.  Well portioned and very, very good.\n\nHowever, my one dinner visit was very sub-par.  I ordered the tacos checandole which comes with marinated pork and pineapple.  I was really looking forward to a meal of savory sweetness, but the meal was a huge disappointment.  To start, the tacos came out room temperature, not hot at all or even remotely warm.  The pork was dry and rather tasteless and there was barely any pineapple to compliment the rest of the meal.  Our waiter highly recommended this dish, so I was even more disappointed knowing that the dish had the potential to be really excellent.\n\nTypically for a 50/50 meal experience I would still give a place three stars, but our service was also on the poor side at my last visit as well.  All of the servers are extremely friendly and welcoming, but it seemed like after we were seated and received our drinks, we barely received attention from the wait staff to see how we were doing.  My friend and I devoured our delicious chips and queso we ordered and were all ready to order more (additional charge be damned), but no one ever came over to us between the time we received our appetizer to the time our meals arrived to see if we'd like anything else.  So we receive our meals and about a third of the way through my tacos I'm out of my drink.  So I stop eating and wait for our waiter to come by so I can flag him down for a refill.  So I'm waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.    I waited 15 minutes, nearly 20, before our waiter finally just happened to walk by our table and notice that my drink was empty.  Mind you he wasn't stopped to check on us, he just happened to notice the empty glass as he whisked by.  So of course by the time I receive my refill my room temperature food had gone completely cold.  Such a disappointing experience for what I feel is really promising restaurant.\nDespite my two stars, I know I'll go back to the restaurant.  If anything I'll go back for an evening visit for the lovely view of Market Square from the second floor windows.  But if my future dinner service is anything like my most recent experience, I think the third visit will probably be my last.", "user_id": "_Ud7sdn_khya8e2f3FNvWA", "business_id": "7xNe2WZAQUGMp1_CxGVKnQ", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I got to try Las Velas for the first time as a member of a 17 person party celebrating two birthdays.  It was a Saturday night and the restaurant had business, but I wouldn't say it was busy.\n\n     We were one of the first couples to arrive so my lady and I ordered drinks.  They offer their own margarita-esque concoctions which we tried.  I went with the Mango/Cayenne variety and she ordered the Raspberry/Chipotle.  We ended up exchanging drinks due to mine being pretty damn good and hers tasting, like you'd expect, a lot like ice cold alcoholic chipotle juice.  After I got most of the bits of chipotle through the straw, the remainder of the drink wasn't half bad.\n\n     Once the party arrived and everyone got drinks and some chips/guac, It took a little longer for our server to return to order entrees, but It just felt like he was giving us all time to settle in with the menu.  It seemed like my fiance and I were the only ones to order a first course, but I like to try as much as possible when dining out.  She got the ceviche and when the server didn't recall the soup of the day off the top of his head, I went with the tortilla soup.  Her ceviche tasted pretty OK.  It had plenty of citrus with lots of tomato and onion and the portion was really large.  One thing I got from it was that it was most likely yesterday's cocktail shrimp and precooked flaked white fish by the texture of it.  My tortilla soup was quite a large portion, maybe 10oz or more by the look of it.  I thought it tasted great, the tortilla strips were a little soggy, but still had their crispiness, and the broth was tasty.\n\n     For our entrees I ordered the chilis rellanos with pork and she got the red snapper al cilantro.  Once we put our orders in our tables didn't have to wait long to be served.  She enjoyed her fish, which was small bites of white fish in a nice cilantro herb sauce with the typical sides.  She was only able to eat about half the ceviche and entree before filling up.  \n\n     My rellanos were kinda disappointing. I ordered them because my go-to at most Mexican restaurants is chilis poblano, which is identical to what I ordered (some places the 'chilis rellanos' is bell pepper instead of poblano).  Well the pepper was nice, battered roasted poblano, but the sauce was pretty boring, and the cheese it was stuffed with wasn't melted or delicious like more fairly priced joints outside the city.  The cheese itself was really spongy, with a texture most comparable to tofu.  The pork that was also stuffed into the pepper was slow roasted and cubed up, and was just OK.  It probably would of stood out better if it was coated in piping hot liquid queso.\n\n     In conclusion, we had a great time, I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of the large party.  Luckily I live east of the city and can find better quality of Mexican if I make a drive the whole way down rt22 to Delmont for Picante Grille.  Also I'm sure rent @ market square is steep, but suck it up and give up a basket of chips and salsa on the house for every two guests seated at your restaurant.  Rely on the quality of your chips as well as the guacamole to up-sale that 2nd basket or the upgrade to the guac.\n\n     I should also note the dining room is well maintained with a great view of the square. We lucked out and finally had some snowfall the night prior, so it was beautiful out.  I'm not opposed to going back, but without some coaxing this won't be my first choice.", "user_id": "bnJYZKRvJ2pu1kaVznKEYw", "business_id": "7xNe2WZAQUGMp1_CxGVKnQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "A friend and I were headed for the disaster at the Cabaret On The Square, and stopped for dinner at Las Velas before the show.  We had a few hours to kill and decided on trying some new Mexican place.  \n\nMaybe it was great company, but Las Velas did not disappoint.  Hugo, the over-gelled but otherwise very nice and kind of hot waiter (seriously...in da burgh, what DOES it mean when a waiter keeps winking at you? I think it simply means tip hard) was very nice and helpful.\n\nWe ordered the poblano dip, an iced tea (since Pepsi products are served) and my friend had a water.  Then for the main course, I ordered the steak burrito, and my friend the quesadillas.\n\nIt was slightly pricey for Mexican food, but what else would we expect for Market Square?\n\nThe Poblano dip was a little runny, but VERY tasty.  The chips were a little over-puffed, which made them frail in the dip, but they were adequate and tasty.\n\nThe steak burrito was large and stuffed, and not only was the steak tasty, but the sauces were 'real' and very flavorful. The sauce wasn't the standard 'red' sauce, but it was real veggie and spice enhanced.   It had zing and flavor.  I LIKE hot.  And no, to me, the standard Pittsburgh version of 'hot' doesn't cut it. A Jalapeno to me is NOT hot.  An Habanero IS. And when they asked if I wanted hot or mild, and I asked for hot, it came hot.\n\nThe burrito came with guacamole, sour cream, and some pico de gallo, which added to the flavor.\n\nMy friend devoured her quesadilla, which came with rice and refried beans, so fast that I thought I'd blinked and missed something.\n\nThe bill, with an appetizer, two entrees and one beverage, was around $40.  \n\nThe atmosphere was very pleasant...heck, we even had one hell of a show as the Occupy Pittsburgh crowd of 20 made their way through Market Square...with six police cars blocking traffic and four local 'media' vans setting up for the five minute span of activity that took place, including one local 'creative' type who wore a pup tent and danced around mindlessly.\n\nAll in all, Las Velas was a very nice place to go for a flavorful Mexican meal, with decent service, and the added bonus of a hot Latino waiter winking, who was delightful to watch 'walk away'.\n\nFor the budget minded, I might recommend Mexico City a few blocks away, but Las Velas is a little better in the atmosphere department, slightly higher in the flavor department, with only a slight hike in the price department. \n\nGive them a try.", "user_id": "tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ", "business_id": "7xNe2WZAQUGMp1_CxGVKnQ", "stars": 4}

Everything from traditional Mexican dishes to having your tacos made \"Tex-Mex\" style, allowing everyone in my party to eat within their own Mexican food comfort zone.  I ordered carnitas tacos. (Because I can't see carnitas on a menu and not order it.  It's just an impulse I have to live with.) They were everything I hoped and dreamed. Literally, I dream about these tacos. The pork was juicy and covered with fresh cilantro and lime, with just a hint of garlic  Ah, so good. \n\nThe only draw back I can find with Las Velas is that the chips and salsa aren't free. Now, I grew up on the West Coast where paying for chips is almost unheard of, however I have noticed charging for these addicting crispy wonders is trend among Pittsburgh's Mexican restaurants.

{"text": "This is the hole-in-the-wall of the Market Square restaurants downtown; I'd never have found if someone hadn't known where the door to the place is. I want to note now that I've only been here once for a spontaneous dinner date - and that only happened because Olive or Twist was completely and totally booked. But now I'm absolutely dying to go here again. The meal I had here hit the spot perfectly.\n\nI'm not even a major fan of Mexican food, so it's very rare for me to heap this sort of praise on Mexican restaurants. I ordered the pork quesadillas, and have to say, they were spot on - also a surprising statement coming from me, because I'm not a major fan of pork, probably because a lot of the time people overcooked pork dishes when I was younger and I grew up thinking all pork is just dry and pretty tasteless. Places like Las Velas remind me that nope, this is not the case - and bless them for it! My meal came with plenty of both the main course and the necessary toppings to spread on each individual quesadilla as I saw fit. There were more than enough toppings to go around, and combined with the juicy pork and toasted quesadilla wrap they made for a wonderful mix of tastes and textures. \n\nBy the way, even if the food wasn't amazing here, I think I would still consider myself a major fan of this place just because of their supremely delicious Peach Margaritas (dying to go back and try the raspberry one). Fortunately the food is as good as the drinks, so everyone wins!\n\nI'll note that even on a not-so-busy night, I, like other reviewers, experienced a little teensy bit of drag in service. Still, I had company and we wanted to talk, so I think as long as I avoid coming here alone or when I'm starving, I'd be able to tolerate this as easily as I did during my first meal here.

When I found out that my workplace's dinner to Il Pizzaiolo was changed to Las Velas, I was pretty disappointed. \n\nMy coworkers and I started off dinner with drinks, and I selected the House Margarita. Personally, the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet. For food, we started with appetizers for the whole group; chips with guacamole and salsa dotted the table. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy. The guacamole was mild and smooth while the salsa provided a fire roasted kick. \n\nThough we were a large group, dinner took a very long time, approximately 1 1/2 hours from ordering to serving. We quickly became antsy, especially since our meetings started very early the next morning. We saw folks around us sit down and enjoy their food as we were still waiting for ours. Eventually, our food emerged from the kitchen, including my steak fajitas. The steak was a little chewy and tough while the tortillas were a bit hard.

I've never been to a Chipotle.\n\nI was part of a party of 8 that dined at Las Velas on a Saturday night.  It wasn't that busy, and we did have a reservation, but when we arrived on time, there was a lot of scrambling to get some tables together to accommodate our party.  \n\nWe got a server who appeared to be in training (as she had someone with her) but neither one of them seemed to understand English. \n\nThey brought waters for everyone at the table, but only one basket of chips and one serving of salsa.

I tried really hard not to be a jerk about it, but I made sure I pointed to what I was ordering on the menu as I was ordering so I could be understood.\n\nI got a regular margarita with salt, and when I told her I had ordered strawberry, the server who had set it in front of me replied: \"No,\" so I said: \"I wanted a strawberry margarita, I ordered a strawberry margarita,\" and she took it away and brought back a strawberry margarita.\n\nThe margarita was okay.  I've read other reviews raving about their margaritas and frankly, I don't get it.  \n\nI received a BOWL of soup (I'd ordered a cup) which was below room temperature and basically looked like someone poured water over a half a cup of salsa and threw in 3 pieces of chicken and some rice, and while I was grateful my chicken quesadilla did not have onions as I had requested, it was cold.\n\nEveryone in our party seemed excited to be with one another, so everyone ate, but no one seemed particularly impressed with anything they ate or drank.

{"text": "Being another single digit February day, I decided that some Tex Mex lunch was in order to warm the day up. I ventured out to Market Square to give Las Velas a try. It may have been a cold day but it didn't keep this place from filling early.  I was hoping to get a seat by the window (or at least a table seat in the dining area) but the bartender / server, noticing that I was solo and \"encouraged\" me to have a seat at the bar. I thought, \"okay, so they want to ensure that couples and groups get a table... I'll play nice\".\n\nAfter looking at the menu, I ordered three tacos Tex Mex style (one steak, one ground beef and one carnitas) with hot salsa. The meal came with two sides so I chose the Esquires (Mexican style corn) and black beans.\n\nIt took about 25 minutes for my order to arrive which I think is a little long to throw three tacos together and when the dish arrived the tacos were sitting in a pool of juice from the corn making them all soggy on the bottom. I propped my plate up on one side by putting my phone under it so that the corn juices wouldn't continue to assault the tacos.  Other than being soggy, the taco's tasted okay, the black beans were uneventful and sadly, the corn was the highlight of the meal with it having a tangy, slightly salty zing.\n\nI feel I'm being generous by giving Las Velas a three stars rating. If you were looking for Mexican food in the downtown area and you stopped and asked me, I would point you in the direction of Bea Taco Town on Smithfield over Las Velas (unless alcohol was a deciding factor).

Unfortunately, this place has proved disappointing on many occasions.\n\nThe first time I ate at Las Velas, I had a really great experience. I ate really light but it was really good. All I ordered was the tortilla soup and I stole some bites of my cousin's refried beans. Both were excellent.\n\nA few months ago, I met a few friends for dinner at Las Velas and did not have the same feelings about the place I had initially had on that first visit. The food took forever to come out and when it did, I had wished it away. The Seviche was disgusting. I love seviche but this was a soupy mess. Nothing tasted fresh about it. The very look was off-putting. All of our tacos and tostadas had dry meat lacking any true flavor. It was a disaster of a meal.\n\nI did try and go back. I understand where a restaurant may have an off day and was willing to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, when I stopped in the other day I was sat at a dirty table and handed a dirty menu that I stared at for 15 minutes (in solitude because a waiter never came) before walking out. I can only give a restaurant so many chances before I just don't want to risk spending the money on a potentially disappointing meal.

It's above Diamond Market so it's sometimes overlooked by newbies to Dahntahn. \n\nStopped in last night for HH before the Pirates Game. Staff was attentive and friendly as usual. The only drag is that there always seems to be a delay at the bar. Drink refills take a while, which is not a plus during HH. I want to get the most for my money! \n\nMy friends and I ordered the following:\n\nLarge margaritas- two strawberry, one regular, and one mango cayenne. All delicious! The mango cayenne is my favorite and talk about a double whammy punch to the tastebuds. The alcohol in the margs is strong so along with the plentiful addition of cayenne pepper, it's a poweful hit to the senses. \n\nChips, queos, gauc and salsa. The chips were a different variety this time (that's how often I go there- I even know the chips! ) They weren't the fresh cut & fried corn tortillas. They seemed like the type of bagged \"authentic mexican chips\" I hope this isn't a permanent change to the menu! Queso was amazing as always, gauc was fresh with huge chunks of avocado and salsa was mild and refreshing. \nEven though we didn't need it (chips and dip is filling!) we ordered two quesadillas, stuffed jalapenos- stuffed with fresco cheese, ground beef, chorizo and drizzled with tamarindo honey sauce and one order of Sopecitos- 4 corn tortillas, topped one each of chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas and cheese. The stuffed jalapenos were each large and lit my mouth on fire. Well done, Las Velas!

{"text": "Since Las Velas is one of the hot spots for night life in Pittsburgh, it also deserves a review! We have been constant customers for Las Velas night life and have been pretty disappointed by the service during saturday night latino dancing! Starting off with the basic sitting room, there are only about 10 tables available for sitting down to have a drink. To use a table you have to pirchase a bucket of beers that usually will cost you less if you go to the bar. There is a waitress that will attend to you at the tables but god knows when she will be back to bring you refills.  A bucket can vary in cost 60 to 70 dollars per bucket and is only beneficial if u have more than 2 people drinking. If you stop drinking buckets of beer, the waitress will ask you to move once you decide not to continue with another bucket even if you still have alcohol to drink from your bucket that you had purchased. The small sala de baile that when dancing you feel as if you are in a bumper car hitting up against a maximum of 20 couples who are able to dance at a time. The rules in regards to tables, alcohol etc continuosly change so although this review may provide an estimate of current pricing that is not to say that without warning the restaurant management will decide to change costs at will.", "user_id": "iNtoGkdktJQyKbiwUdURxw", "business_id": "7xNe2WZAQUGMp1_CxGVKnQ", "stars": 1}

{"text": "Happy hour fans rejoice! This is a great little spot for indulging in some cheap post-work snacks and libations. Located above Diamond Market in Market Square, Las Velas is a fairly typical Mexican restaurant. Their happy hour runs weekdays from 4-6pm, and I was shocked at how few people were taking advantage of this on a recent Friday evening when I was there (come on, Pittsburghers, I know you like to drink!!) \n\nAnyway, the happy hour specials are $2 off of house sangrias and margaritas, as well as half off appetizers (excluding chips and salsa or queso). My friend warned me how strong their margaritas are, and I didn't want the evening to turn into a dancing-with-a-lampshade-on-my-head kinda night....so I opted for a sangria. And it was delicious! For food, my friend and I shared some chips and queso/salsa, chicken flautas, and chicken quesadillas. \n\nConsidering the happy hour prices, I was quite pleased. It's not Mexican food that will blow your mind, but it's definitely decent for happy hour munchies. Their chips are homemade and perfectly thick and crispy. The salsa was typical Mexican restaurant-style salsa...thinner and more sauce-like as opposed to thick and chunky. There is a decent amount of cilantro in it though, so I'm a fan. Their queso was very rich and cheesy. It was good, but for my tastes, they could have ratcheted up the flavor and spiciness a bit. The flautas and quesadillas were both also decent...crispy without being greasy, and generously stuffed with fillings. Each also came with abundant guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, and pico on the side to dress them up as you like. The one thing I will say across all of the food is that it was all a little lukewarm. It wasn't lukewarm to the point of making it inedible, but I think in general the food could have been served at a higher temperature to make it more enjoyable.\n\nAs for the service, it was fast and friendly. All in all, my friend and I had a drink (she had two), and a ton of food that left us stuffed and happy, and we walked out of there each having paid like $12 or something.

I could live off of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. From awful (not even close to real Mexican) Taco Bell bean burritos, to some of the most amazing food (Mexican or otherwise) that I had in a variety of restaurants in San Diego... GIVE ME TACOS NOW.\n\nYesterday in the full on miserable chaos of Pittsburgh's Southside St. Patrick's Day celebration, we decided to go for Mexican rather than bar food. I could not have been happier. This was, without a doubt in my mind, the highlight of a rainy obnoxious holiday that the majority uses as an excuse to be poorly mannered. \n\nWalking into the establishment in an area of the Southside that I rarely venture to (Not a big fan of gentrification of most city's neighborhoods.) was a pleasant surprise. The hosting staff was friendly and attentive even on a very busy day like Saturday was. We were immediately seated and our drink orders were taken. Truth be told, I'm a beer girl at heart. I can no pass up a decent margarita on the rocks. While $9 was a little steep for me as far as drinks go (mainly because I rarely want to have just ONE margarita), the pomegranate margarita on the rocks was delicious. Served the first time with a slice of lime and the second time with a slice of orange, I preferred the pomegranate with orange slice combo best.\n\nThe menu is a little pricey but this isn't Taco Bell. They have a lot of authentic Mexican choices and I honestly had a difficult time choosing. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious, fresh, and quickly refilled. In the end I kept it simple and went with the grilled carne asada tacos. The meat was delicious and the salsa and beans/rice/etc was really well cooked.\n\nIn all the service was great, the food was delicious if a bit pricey, and the drinks were spectacular.

I highly recommend looking for the \"Emiliano's Specialties\" which are marked on the menu and ordering one of those and skipping the standard Mexican Restaurant fare if you want something different or really authentic. \n\nThings like the cheese enchiladas and chicken fajitas are pretty pedestrian. I mean, they taste the same here as they did at most other restaurants - if that is what you are hungry for, you will be pleased. I have gotten both of those items and been completely satisfied with their quality because I haven't expected them to be better than all the others I have had.

Their corn flour has a unique, sweet flavor that balances well with the pepper and cheese. If you're looking for something more TexMex the chicken with bacon and Monterrey Jack cheese fajitas are really tasty. The bacon is just an unexpected salty/smokey flavor that pairs well with the creamy cheese and roasted peppers and onions. \n\nI like their salsa, but if you don't like cilantro, you might not. I have gotten their chips warm and room temp, the warm ones were MUCH better. Also, I love that they refill the chips and salsa for free.

After doing some Yelping, and finding that it was one of the only places open that fairly cheap, and had a diverse enough menu to cater to everyone, we decided to head to Emilianos Mexican Grill & Bar. After about a ten minute cab ride from downtown, we were ready to feast.\n\nAfter arriving, we were seated promptly, and given our complimentary chips and salsa. As far as the menu goes, this place has all the standard offerings you would find at any similar Mexican restaurant, not that that is a bad thing necessarily. The food itself was pretty tasty, and I made sure to clean my plate. Is it something insanely awesome? Not really, but it does the trick.\n\nAlong with the good food and service, Emilianos was exceptionally clean, which is always a plus when dining out.

I needed a relatively cheap, laid-back restaurant to take my date, and it fit the criteria perfectly. \n\nThe good: \n\nFree chips and salsa, keeps your mind off waiting for your food, and the fresh chips and salsa were excellent. \n\nExcellent service. My waiter was always bringing me more tea, without asking, and kept out chip basket filled. We also were just conversing about an unidentified yellow cube on my date's plate, and a passing waitress let us know that it was mango, asked us if we needed anything, and let us be again.\n\nPortions were more than enough. I missed lunch, and between the chips and my entree I left stuffed, and I'm a bigger guy. Also, entrees are around $12-15, appetizers are about $4 for bean dip, cheese dip, or guacamole (which was very good) and $6-8 for other typical appetizers. The price was definitely fair, but I wouldn't say it was a steal either.\n\nI had an excellent chicken and veggies over rice dish (something con pollo), and would recommend it. Very crisp vegetable tastes that still blended with the cheese sauce and sour cream. I loved every bite. My date got the appetizer quesadillas, and said they weren't anything special, and the bite I took of them confirmed this. \n\nThe bad: \n\nThe atmosphere is laid back, especially for the two seat tables. The booths looked cozy though. It's a nice place to take a girl if you're not looking for anything too serious, just a quick bite and a movie.\n\nThe menu seems kind of inaccessible, so if you're bringing a group or date that's not up to snuff on the cuisine terms, you'll have to do a bit of explaining.\n\nThe prices were right on, expect to get what to pay for, but not much more.\n\nOverall a good place to grab a bite, and I'd recommend it to a friend, so it's gotten my nod of approval.", "user_id": "bTavSZEKTRo2tYf3kvhJow", "business_id": "LvdvLtCbAriMJp6cjLm9EA", "stars": 4}

Here is the story of my latest trip. \n\nWe will start with the decor. It was bland and boring and just rang of some gringo's idea of what Mexico looks like based on a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon. Plus the tables are so small a party of four didn't have enough room for drinks and plates; we had to hijack a nearby empty table because the plates were so huge. \n\nOn to the service now. One big note to good service: don't be strung out when working. Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table. She took her merry time getting drinks (15 minutes for 2 drafts) she checked in in us maybe once. The only upside was that the food came out quickly. \n\nThe downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag. I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings. Big mistake. I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six. The chicken was dry and tough. The tamale corn was soggy and gritty. The tortillas were crap. The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef. All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing. The rice was hard. The refried beans were processes and pur\u00e9ed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn.  If they charged Taco Bell prices I wouldn't be as upset but this wasn't cheap either. \n\nTo finish up Emiliano's is a stain on the name of Mexico. They know most Americans wouldn't know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face.

There was a sauce on the veggies, but it was dark.. I'm not sure in a pineapple glaze/sauce is dark. The rice reminded me of Uncle Bens (I'm eating clean so I can spot pre-packaged food easily now.. It might have been packaged, it might not have been.. who knows) The refried beans were yummy!! Bobby ordered the faita plate. He said it was good, but again could have had better flavor for it being a Mexican restrauant. Honestly it tasted similar to something from Applebees.

The service was slow even though it wasn't too crowded. Our server was friendly albeit slow. We were given free chips and salsa while we waited, but there was only a small bowl of each placed on the table . The chips were good, but too small for our group. After we had about one chip each we were out of salsa and had to ask for more. When the runner finally arrived with our food the table was almost too small for all of our stuff, but we made it work. The food was hot and looked great. Two of us got the \"Build Your Own Combo\" with one of each enchilada, burrito, rice, and sweet potato fries. I remember the others ordered the Choripollo Taco Stand, Enchiladas Suizas, and Emiliano's Fajitas. We all enjoyed our food and were very full when we finished. The rice was very good, neither overcooked nor under-cooked, and my burrito and enchilada were your standard pseudo-Mexican fare (super cheesy and yummy). My friends also enjoyed their meals and the reasonably priced mojitos and fishbowl margaritas were tasty.\n\nMy second trip there wasn't so great. It was during the weekday and before the dinner time rush so my friend and I were seated outside quickly. Our waitress was not only slow, she was also very clumsy (dropping our menus twice, spilling water and salsa, and bumping into our table). She was friendly enough and repeatedly apologized so we chalked it up to her having a bad day. Again we both got the \"Build Your Own Combo.\" I got the taco, tamale, rice, and sweet potato fries. My friend chose the taco, burrito, soup, beans ,and fries. When the food arrived I swear the plate was hotter than my entree and the cheese was barely melted. The fries were over-cooked, the tamale was too mushy and hard to eat (I literally had to force it down) and my friend said that her taco was one of the grosses she has ever had. The rice was palatable and my friend really enjoyed her soup. The waitress was so slow in bringing our checks that we decided to just pay cash to avoid waiting for her to return our cards.

Luckily that has improved over the years.  Emilianos is a place I knew existed, but for some reason I never actually made the trip to the South Side to try it out until last night.\n\nMany of the other reviews on this site are spot on.  The one critique I saw in other reviews that I didn't experience was poor service.  We were visiting on a cold Wednesday night, so perhaps the fact that it was a slower time affected this.  Regardless, our service was excellent, if not overbearing at times.  I think our server visited our table at least 5 times during the course of our meal.  Perhaps they have read their reviews and focused on this.\n\nThe meal started promising enough.  I was happy to see free unlimited chips and salsa.  That is becoming rare these days.  In addition, the margaritas were quite good as well.  My girlfriend had the Sangria Margarita, and it bordered on too sour at times, but it was acceptable.  The food was just 'ok'.  That's the best way to put it.  I had the steak fajitas and my girlfriend had the steak fajita quesadilla.  My fajitas were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but perfectly acceptable for a fajita.  The quesadilla was another story.  First of all, it wasn't even cut, which was bizarre.  It arrived at the table as a complete folded over tortilla.  Second, one of the main components of a quesadilla is cheese, and the cheese that was in her dish was odd to say the least.  I would put it somewhere between a queso sauce and the pump cheese you get on your nachos at a ballpark.  I would have expected a melted shredded cheese of some sort.\n\nI didn't hate my meal, but for the price (45 dollars for 2 entrees and 2 margaritas), I would probably take my service elsewhere the next time I get a craving for Mexican cuisine.", "user_id": "V1IfutmnbGadDnLmHlOK2Q", "business_id": "LvdvLtCbAriMJp6cjLm9EA", "stars": 3}

I like food that reminds me of what my great grandmother would make and he likes Tex-Mex (anywhere that puts cheese on their tacos) Emiliano's seemed like a good compromise. He ordered the shrimp taco salad and I got shrimp Vallarta. We also shared some guacamole. The guacamole was good and made table side. My boyfriend's salad looked pretty tasty to me but he was not impressed. The shrimp Vallarta was extremely disappointing. It tasted like a plate of shrimp covered in ketchup. I know that the sauce should have a similar taste profile because of the ancho and vinegar. But, this was almost as is if they cooked shrimp and poured a bottle of sacred Heinz all over.

This extra charge is not listed on the menu and it's a vegetarian burrito, what else would you put in it? Chipotle has tofu, Qdoba does not. I did not get the grilled veggies on it because they are always salty and normally I just get a lot of lettuce on it beside the rice and beans. Now it is not like I wanted a bowl of lettuce just 1 extra scoop and yes there is a charge for that. I have never been  charged extra at any other Qdoba nor at this store in the evening for lettuce. What made it even more surprising is this extra charge is not listed on the menu.  So when asked for a customer service number to file a complaint she kept insisting I call the survey number on my receipt to speak to a live person....total lie no live person just a recording so I ask her for a store manager or a districts manager 's name and she claims there isn't one that they are between district managers..Finally I gave up and searched online,  found a customer service number where an actual personal answered, got a store and a district manager's name and a promise of a return call.

{"text": "As fast food goes, I generally avoid it like the plague that it has become, but when our company received an envelope full of two-for-one coupons, with my limited choices for decent and affordable lunches downtown on days that I'd not prepped something at home, Qdoba won me for at least a try, and they became like my fifth in line for something to eat downtown.\n\nThese coupons were only good for this one specific location downtown, so this location got us.\n\nI have to say, I wasn't disappointed, and over the course of the next two months, we went through quite a few of these coupons. Almost every time we went in, the place was really busy, but they've divided it into two lines. One for burritos only, and the other for the rest, and it seems to work out rather well for keeping a smooth and timely flow. \n\nThe food itself is pretty good. I mean it IS fast food, so the crew from The Chew won't be standing in line to assess its gourmet goodness, but considering the crap that most conveyor belt fast fooderies crank out, Qdoba actually puts out a decent edible and I dare say even tasty product. I've gotten steak burritos and nachos, and neither have disappointed. They are decent sized, filling, and come with that thing that eludes a lot of fast food factories...flavor. It's not what I'd call cheap, nor is it expensive. For what you get, it's about right. The steak doesn't taste like freeze dried dog food, and the additives like guacamole and cheese are fresh. \n\nAdditionally, the staff at this particular location isn't the usual paper-hatted line-up of minimum wage zombies. Some of them are actually kind of adorable, including the little guy who usually starts you off in the burrito line. A slightly cherubic guy, he's friendly, being the starter of the burrito, with the tortilla, meat and rice/beans, seems to genuinely like his customers, and then he passes you on to the next staff member who will stuff the remainder of goodies into your burrito, and usually, they're just as friendly. \n\nAll in all, this is a nice option for a downtown quick lunch.

But Qdoba was the order of the day today and I must say that it wasn't half bad.\n\nI got the burrito bowl which is essentially all the stuff you'd find in a burrito without the tortilla. You get your choice of white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, grilled chicken, ground beef, pulled pork, grilled steak, or shredded beef covered in a sauce, veggies, salsa and cheese. The layout is a bit cramped and the service is assembly line / cafeteria style as you individualize your meal and then pay at the end.

I found the servers behind the line to employ brevity in a courteous way while trying to keep people moving through the line.

Fully stocked grocery store with great produce (huge pile of tomatillos) and meat - everything you need to make that recipe you found in your favorite Diana Kennedy cookbook.  (Cheap Inca Kola!  Found my fix.)\n\nMost of you are more interested in the tacos, and I'll confirm that you can't go wrong there, either.  Real tacos - I tried puerco, barbacoa, and asada.  All were very good; the pork was exceptional - muy rica.  These are the real deal for street tacos, too - just like what I found in Atlanta and San Diego in past lives.  Only $2 (never pay $3 for a taco), and they're stuffed with easily twice as much fillin's as what you'll get at any other taco place in town.  (Note to their competition: tacos shouldn't be huge, but they're not appetizers, either.  I'm tired of eating three at the trendier places and still being hungry.  Four with no sides should completely stuff an adult male.)  The \"fixin's\" station is nice, too - faster and easier than having to wait on \"the guy\" to put it on.\n\nFour stars for the grocery store and five for the taco stand.

One chooses between a couple different delicious looking meat including steak and onions, sausage and pork.   One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!\n\nSo for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).  \n\nDo they beat out Reyna's tacos?

{"text": "It's a grocery store. NO! It's a taco stand. NO! It's a silly novelty pinata peddler. It's really all of these things. After reading lots of reviews, and with a hankerin' for some delicious authentic tacos, the decision was made. It was below zero around dinner time, which made me wonder where they move this \"stand\" when it's frigid outside. Surely, they move it inside. THEY DO NOT. These friendly dudes were still there, outside the store.  Under a pop-up tent, just like in the Yelp photos. They were happily grilling meats and authentic from-scratch(!) corn tortillas. These guys are hard-core, and they put this same determination into their offerings. One of the guys told us that they're out there \"365 days of the week\", which probably feels pretty accurate when it's that cold outside.\n\nFor the anxious, here's the way it goes:\n1. Stop outside where they're grilling. They will gladly show you the choices of meats (I believe they also do just veggies...). When I went, they had chorizo sausage, steak, fajita mix, chicken, and a few others. Let them know how many tacos you'd like - they're $2 each. I got three, and it was plenty. They'll put them in a styrofoam container.\n\n2. Head inside the store. Just to the left, there's a salsa bar. Generally speaking, the milder toppings/sauces start on the left, and gradually get spicier toward the right. The guac is fantastic. The salsas are fresh and oh-so-good. The sauces don't disappoint, either. Don't be shy - load 'em up! I typically like my foods pretty spicy (ex: I frequently order my Thai food with a '10' on a '1-10' spicy scale), and the sauces all the way to the right don't disappoint. They're definitely on the hot side, but not overly-so.\n\n3. (Optional) Stroll around the store, pick out a drink along the left-most wall. There are lots of choices - I'm a fan of the Jarritos drinks. Mango is awesome, and goes well with the tacos. There are some gems in this store - like nearly an entire aisle of just hot sauces, and lots of fresh produce. (The peppers looked amazing!)\n\n4. Pay for your food at the front. Just let them know how many tacos you have. They're super friendly, but may not speak fluent English. Part of the charm and authenticity!\n\n5. We were welcomed to stand in the store and eat our food, but we opted to take it home instead. There are no seats or tables inside, though.\n\nI will definitely be back - for both tacos and Mexican ingredients for cooking.", "user_id": "xQT4zNWctXLd7q4VIjfsKQ", "business_id": "QR_Nmup1tRj1WwooAKePbg", "stars": 5}

I had noticed this place the week before whenever we went by and became eager to try it whenever I noticed its high rating on yelp.  Since I didn't go into the store, the only real thing I can comment on is the taco stand outside.  There was a guy behind the stand cooking everything as well as a condiment bar next to it.  Whenever we walked up he was just finishing up grilling some tortillas.  He greeted us in Spanish before giving us a run down of the taco fillers in English.  I ended getting three, one each of steak, chorizo and chicken.  He quickly made the tacos stuffing them very full.  They consisted of two tortillas with the filling which reminded me of truly authentic tacos.  Whenever I asked about paying he informed that I could pay cash outside or credit inside.  Since I had cash I quickly payed him and moved over to the condiment bar.  They had a number of sauces as well as some onions and a few other veggies.  I ultimately ended up choosing what I think was an avocado based sauce.  Once we were done with the condiments my father and I walked down the boulevard to find a public bench to eat our tacos on.  After sitting down I quickly dug in.  All three of them were delicious!  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the steak, followed by the chicken and lastly the chorizo.  The chorizo was the lone disappointment of the meal as I feel it lacked any spice at all but it was still pretty tasty.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will absolutely head back here again in the future.

With so many topping choices you can dress up each taco different. The veggie taco I ordered came with potatoes and grilled poblano peppers.

So you can imagine my enthusiasm when I had heard Chipotle was coming downtown (I work downtown). My coworkers didn't have to imagine my enthusiasm they heard about it until I finally got myself down to Chips and had a go. \n\nI came back sorta like Charlie Brown on a rainy day - head hung low, sad music in the background. I struggled to tell my coworkers that something was just off and the Chips in downtown wasn't all I had hoped. \n\nI still encouraged them to go, but with a caveat that there are better Chipotles out there and if they go to another city to check them out. While I've gone to this Chipotle a handful of times, I can't help but feel nostalgic about the memories of a 5 star Chipotle.", "user_id": "D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg", "business_id": "yCyLqBX3aujcR0SeIuxSWw", "stars": 3}

I just wanted to kick myself for somehow overlooking how great Chipotle is all this time.\n\nI highly recommend the Burrito Bowl, the featured item when I went yesterday.

I ordered the burrito bowl with sofritas. This probably depends on the person scooping the rice and ingredients, but in what I got, the portion size was disappointingly small for the price. The dining area is small and cramped for the crowd. Even when I was seated, I had people bump into me a bunch of times, which was annoying.

And hey, I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is not an easy location to work at. This Chipotle is smack in the middle of a hubspot of downtown activity. It always has a line, and they have to do their best with the space, hands and time they're given. So seriously, good on them - they at least seemed to have a handle on keeping their line of patrons moving when I stopped in.\n\nWhat they clearly don't have a handle on, though, are online orders. I had ordered my dinner via the Chipotle app specifically because I knew I would have about 20 minutes to get where I needed to go that night downtown after parking. So I put in a pickup time for 7:45 so I could eat as I strolled on over to my next appointment. Unfortunately, even though Chipotle promises that ordering through an app will guarantee your food is ready to go when you arrive, the staff ruined my plan, and didn't even start to make my order until I arrived. As a result I basically ended up in the back of the line, and I had to eat as I half jogged on down to my next stop that night; it was either that or not get dinner until 11pm.\n\nAfter that, I'm definitely going to avoid this location if I can. Their food may be worth a 5 star rating but that type of failure to meet company standards is a definitive 1 in my book - my 3 star rating is basically a balance of this. I certainly appreciate why they're always busy. That's not the problem. My problem was that they completely ignored my order until I arrived, the exact opposite of what app users are promised. If they're too busy to make app orders on time, they should look into being removed from the online ordering system.

Hardly, but their tacos are pretty good.\n\nOne pork belly taco will run you around $3, which is kind of crazy considering that's more expensive than the ones you get in the touristier Strip at Reynas, but these ones are way better. The pork belly was a little more belly fat than pork, but the flavoring was knock-out, as was the seasoning on the pollo, and carne asada. And they were mostly meat. Yay!\n\nThe walls are a disorienting mix of deep purple, bubble-gum pink and sunshine yellow. I usually like the way over-saturated colors kind of automatically lift my serotonin, but bad lighting make the restaurant feel dim overall. There's not much in the way of decorations, but the wall as you walk in features a big ass menu that's so expansive it would make Lewis and Clark think twice. So, again, although tacos are the litmus test for Mexican restaurants in my mind, I'm not going to pretend like Los Cabos and I won't be meeting again, and again, and again.\n\n*Let it be known that I think there are plenty of awesome Mexican restaurants in PGH, but that there's also lots of room for improvement: restaurateurs, are you listening?!", "user_id": "-Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg", "business_id": "AuQD43d9bgvxbFVZiwC0ig", "stars": 3}

{"text": "I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good \"Mex\" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. \nFirst, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the \"California Surfing\" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. \nThe only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. \nIt's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. \nI have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times.

Granted, it's probably not the best tasting quesadilla I've ever had, but it's definitely the best I've tried in Pittsburgh! I also appreciate that they throw in a free basket of chips and salsa with your order (what's with the whole charging for a basket of chips? I've never seen that until I moved here!).

Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult - rice, beans, tortilla shells...but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands.\nI tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos.  Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries...maybe  a little cheese.  No Guac, no salsa to be seen.  I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1/2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice.  The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch.\nMy friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department - he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans.\nSo no matter how late or drunk you are - pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos.", "user_id": "g24_vs6x7UImydzfamDlBg", "business_id": "AuQD43d9bgvxbFVZiwC0ig", "stars": 1}

Normally we would dine in at a new restaurant before getting take out, because restaurants deserve  some leeway in terms of food quality when it comes to takeout due to the presentation and vehicle ride home.  That being said, Los Cabos was the absolute worst Mexican Food I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  I've had much better food at Mexican chain restaurants. We started with guacamole and chips which I can't really say anything negative or positive about.  It tasted no better or worse than the usual guac and chips.  The salsa, however, was watered down and had no taste worth mentioning.  I also made the mistake of pouring the pico de gallo on my tortilla which was also extremely watery. I had the Carne Asada, and the meat tasted like stringy jerky.  I'm surprised I was able to chew off pieces without first cutting the meat across the grain. The Mexican rice that accompanied my dish was mediocre, and the refried beans were much too salty.  I tried a few bites of my partner's Chili relleno, which tasted like mushy, old, frozen mozzarella sticks.  She also had a beef taco and chicken tamale, both of which had a few morsels of meat and were almost entirely filled with lettuce.

The guacamole was fresh, with a fine blend of tomatoes and shredded cheese on it. It was a big portion and tasted reasonable, but definitely not one of those -will die for it- guac. We ordered the combination meals and I got the enchilada and chille releno. The enchilada was perfect, and the sauce was fresh and flavorful. The chille releno was good too! We also got the tamale and oh man, it was great! Having become a recent fan of tamales, I was so happy to find good tamales in Pittsburgh.\n\nWill definitely come back here to get dinner/take out again.", "user_id": "p0Wfk6yWkcsYxRxE7VecKw", "business_id": "AuQD43d9bgvxbFVZiwC0ig", "stars": 4}
{"text": "Having a taco joint open up in Shadyside was just about the best thing that has happened since I came to Pittsburgh.  As soon as I saw a brief mention of this place on the talk pages of Yelp Pittsburgh, I monitored their progress towards opening by \"liking\" their page on facebook. It finally opened while I was out of town, so I made it a point to try this place as soon as I got back.  Walking back from school yesterday (Monday), I walked up and realized that they're not open on Mondays.  So I tried again today.\n\nThe brightly painted walls of this place remind me of a traditional mexican restaurant.  When you first walk in, their gelato lies in a similar position where Mercurio's gelatos used to lie.  From the end of the table, I ordered two tacos to go - one al pastor and the other carnitas.  They offer a number of salsas, and it seems that you can pack your own, even though they initially ask whether you want any one in particular.\n\nWhile i waited, i sampled the mojito gelato (\"with real booze\"), one of their many interestingly flavors.  It was surprisingly light and tasty, although there were quite a few ice crystals in my sample because the lady scooped from the surface.  I'll most likely try a cup of this the next time I come back; it has just the right lightness that I like for a summer snack/dessert.\n\nMy order was fulfilled in a reasonable time (there was only one other party that had finished eating already).  I walked home as quickly as I could so that I could enjoy my tacos while they were still warm and so that the juices from the meat wouldn't soak through the corn tortilla.  My only thought on the walk back was, \"I hope they put two corn tortillas, unlike reyna foods...\"\n\nAnd there were two corn tortillas!  The tacos aren't fully decked out like the \"super tacos\" of small mexican joints - as seen in the pictures, they provide the meat and some diced onions/cilantro. no lettuce, tomato, or any of that stuff. I asked for a bit of their medium house salsa, which came on the side. it was very mild for my taste (I could barely taste any spicyness), so I'll be trying their next level up next time I go.  The carnitas was slightly dryer than I expected, which eliminated the soggy corn tortilla problem.  The corn tortilla had cooled down, and I think it would have tasted better if left on the griddle slightly longer.  The pineapple on the al pastor taco definitely helped the taste a bit, but like the carnitas, they were just a tad underseasoned.   They put one salsa cup in my bag, which I ran out after 1.5 tacos, which meant that I barely had any salsa for my chips.  So if you get your order to go, make sure you have enough salsa! The chips that were also provided in a small bag was a nice accompaniment to my tacos. Thumbs up for not putting much salt on them. For two tacos my meal came out to be ~7.50, which is high/very high for the standard, but based on location (being in shadyside), I understand their pricing, and I don't have much to complain about.  I hope they'll have those spicy pickled veggies (Carrots, jalapenos, onions etc) soon! those will definitely be a great condiment for the tacos in addition to solely salsa.\n\nBased on my review, I may just be accustomed to slightly heavier tastes (more spicyness, more spices).  Go and try this place! This places deserves to stay around.", "user_id": "oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg", "business_id": "KJyIMrkHzafvz515f0W8Iw", "stars": 3}
{"text": "The nice thing about this place is that they are \"trying\" to serve authentic mexican food, however, while they have good intentions, what they prepare  is a debauchery of it. \n\nWhile they serve some of the classics, their choice of ingredients just plain SUCK!  their tortillas are very dry, not warm and moist.  They managed to double their tortillas up, which is correct, but they didn't cook them properly! They definetley \"heard\" about corn on the cob smothered in mayo and parmesean cheese....but you have to use real ROASTED sweet corn....not half-boiled yellow corn!  \n\nTheir salsas are bland, not fresh and vibrant.  their meat is underseasoned and bland too.  No dynamics between dishes.  This restaraunt is trying to mimic authentic mexican food, but is failing miserably.  \n\nNonetheless, if you have never experienced real mexican food before, you may still be fooled into thinking they serve good tacos.  \n\nEverything they serve \"looks\" just right, but the taste is far from accurate.

I was super excited to now have a Mexican joint nearby!  Sadly, I have been very disappointed by my recent experiance.  1) I went there during my lunch break, it took them 25min to make me two tacos (beef and chicken).  10min would be acceptable since I know they make everything to order...but I was the only customer at the time!  2) As I mentioned I got 2 tacos, one beef one chicken. The only thing that comes on the tacos is the meat, cilantro, and queso fresca.  I had to pay extra for tomatos, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guac.  Therefore my two tacos ended up costing me $11.25!

{"text": "I really considered not writing this review at all. A lot of the other reviewers here seem to have experienced similar trepidation, but I guess that says something about the restaurant itself.\n\nI fortuitously managed to try Chica Loca on Taco Tuesday(!) and was treated to the super-special deal of 2 tacos for $5, otherwise known as, exactly how much tacos should cost. The chorizo (sourced from Las Palmas in Oakland) taco was really tasty. As noted, they provide the traditional taco format: 2 corn tortillas, lime wedge, topped with cilantro, queso fresco, and diced onion. I got mine with pico de gallo but craved more taste and ended up using extra spicy salsa. The carnitas taco was good, I suppose. Individually, the meat was flavorful and tasty but it got lost in, surprisingly enough, the tortillas. You know there is a problem with your seasoning when it gets overpowered by corn tortillas...\n\nThe decor is nothing to write home about: chairs and tables that would look normal on a suburban deck, bright wall colors, and a rather bizarre shotgun layout in which the counter is at the far back, requiring you to walk down the 4 foot aisle past other eaters.\n\nI feel bad because I love eating tacos and supporting local business but I was not that happy with this place. I tried to order the \"super secret salsa\" as well as the tomatillo salsa and was informed that they were out (this was around 7pm on a weekday). I think the woman I was speaking with was the owner and she was very nice and talkative, encouraging me to return and try the salsas I missed. I probably will go back one day because it was objectively enjoyable food. That said, I would only go back on a tuesday. Having never tried their more expensive tacos, I still think I can say their prices are absurd. Show me a fish taco worth $7.50 and I will gladly devour it.

{"text": "This space on Copeland Street has seen it's share of different business and, despite having lived here for 10 years, it's the first time we've set foot on this floor of the building. But with growling stomachs and a nearby parking spot secured, the promise of a little south of the border lunch lured us in.\n\nChica Loca Taco is a suprisingly bright space despite minimal windows. It's very clean and spare with bright, colorful artwork and furnishings. One drawback that my partner picked up on upon entering was a thick smell of cooking in the air. We avoid any bars that allow smoking because it penetrates your clothes. Although the smell in Chica Loca was not unpleasant (as cigarette smoke is to us), we really prefer to not smell like a restaurant when we leave. We're not sure if this is due to inadequate ventilation or just a byproduct of the open cooking area. Can you fix this?\n\nThe menu featured several different types of soft flour tacos with either chicken, shredded pork, veggie, chorizo and a few other options. I asked the server (who was very perky and smiley) if most people order one or two tacos. She said people usually order two because they are about 6\" round. So, two it was!\n\nI ordered one each of the carnitas and chorizo tacos. They were automatically dosed with cheese (quesa fresca), onions and cilantro. Other fixins were available at additional cost but the standards were fine for me. As we waited for our order, we were given one bowl of house fried tortilla chips with two small cups of salsa (of our choosing). My partner's medium house salsa was run-of-the-mill red tomato salsa with just enough bite to avoid having to down an entire glass of water before our meal arrived...maybe just a few sips. My tomatillo salsa was disappointing. Then again, sometimes you get what you ask for. It was finely diced tomatillos, nothing more. It was pretty bland and would have benefited from a touch of salt, garlic, onion and perhaps some jalape\u00f1o.\n\nThe tacos arrived in about five minutes and were pretty darn tasty. The soft flour shells were a little dry but the fillings were flavorful, which is the most important part (for me, anyway). Each taco was wrapped in two 6\" tortillas which was a pleasant surprise instead of only one which would have likely fallen apart under the weight and wet of the insides. The chorizo was mildly spicy and melded swimmingly with the cheese and accoutrements. The shredded pork was juicy and flavorful. We made short work of them and were a little surprised how full we felt despite the seemingly small lunch. Oh, and for all this around 15 bucks. Not too shabby for a tasty Shadyside lunch.\n\nChica Loca is not Mad Mex or Taco Bell (thank God it's not the latter). Chica Loca hews a little closer to authentic Mexican food which does not drown it's offerings in sauces and gooey cheese. Simple, fresh (my partner remarked how fresh the tacos tasted) and fast. It's definitely worth fighting for a precious Shadyside parking spot.", "user_id": "d-j6xeSfY2CAfGHGO15QIQ", "business_id": "KJyIMrkHzafvz515f0W8Iw", "stars": 3}

We only really wanted margs and chips/guac anyway, so thought it was only fair that we go into the bar area in the middle of the restaurant for our happy hour - and by 'happy' I was shooting for 'getting to sit' and by 'hour' I mean I didn't have all night.  So we get our drinks and end up standing quite awhile behind the people sitting at the bar, as many of them save seats for their late/invisible friends. We were getting really hungry for something to nosh on and couldn't really see a way to do this when we couldn't even physically reach the bar, so we decide to try our luck hovering by the bar tables instead... low and behold, one finally opens up!!

{"text": "I have mixed feelings about Mad Mex.  I get really excited about going there, but the food always falls a notch short of my expectations.  But then, a few weeks or months later, I make plans to go back and I get all pumped up about it....and then the food is mediocre.  I guess I just have selective memory about Mad Mex - all I remember is the fun atmosphere and the chance to have margaritas with friends, and I block out the disappointing food.\n\nYesterday was my first time at this Mad Mex.  It was during the crazy heat wave, and I went with a big group of girls around 6 pm for Happy Hour.  And....the power was out.  Not on the whole block, just at Mad Mex.  Maybe their AC was cranked up so high they blew a fuse?  One of the girls in our group said this actually happened the last time she was at this location - in May - so apparently it's more than a one-time thing.\n\nLots of people were leaving, since the power was out, but we actually decided to go ahead and get a table since there was no wait!  I guarantee you there would be a wait normally, but if you are lucky enough to go when there's a power outage, you get seated immediately!  The big windows provided enough light to see, and it was a bit humid in there but not too bad.  The bar was still open, so we got margaritas ($7 for a \"Big Azz\" 22 oz) and chips and salsa.  The margarita was really tasty, but not strong at all.  If I'm getting a 22 oz margarita, I want to feel tipsy - especially on an empty stomach - but I barely got a buzz with this one.  Boo!  Maybe their tequila bottle runs on electricity and was experiencing the power shortage too.\n\nThe chips and dips were great, though.  Yummy, fresh guacamole....and the pineapple-habanero salsa was DELISH.  I could eat that all day.  It was sort of thin, with a soupy consistency, but my goodness was it yummy.  Sweet and fruity, with a huge spice kick!  I will definitely get that next time, because who am I kidding - I'll be back again, I'm sure.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, the lights came back on!  Yaaaaaay!  So we got to order food.  I was pretty full on chips, so I just got a bowl of chickpea chili.  It was okay....really not that great.  It was super thin, and salty, with some chickpeas and cheese floating around in it.  It wasn't very strongly flavored, not very gourmet, not very special.  It was okay to dip chips in, but it was nothing I'd bother ordering again.  I just got it because it's one of the only things on the menu that doesn't have like, a thousand calories.  I'm really not a calorie-counter usually, but I try not to eat my entire days worth of calories in one sitting, if I can help it.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun, a little noisy, but you can hear your friends.  I love the big windows, and this location is much more light and spacious than the evil Oakland location.  I think though, this place is not worth the hype.  With the decor and the crowds, you think \"I'm having fun!\"  But if you stop for a minute and notice what you're actually eating or drinking, you realize that it's okay, but not really worth the excitement.  But the spirit of the place is kind of addicting - seriously, if somebody asked me to go back tomorrow, I'd totally do it.

I also recommend the nachos.  The chicken nachos are fully loaded with chicken, guac, sour cream, jalapenos, cheese, beans and salsa.  It's a huge serving and could be a meal in itself.  Hands down, best nachos I've ever had and great to share with a group.  I also recommend doing the three salsa/dip deal as an appetizer.  The queso, guac, regular salsa and the pineapple habanero are quite tasty.  The pineapple one is really hot though so don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nNow, I know everyone goes here for the margaritas which are a steal during happy hour but I've recently tried the red sangria and was delighted.

{"text": "I've been waiting to review this Mex since it opened right by mi casa.  I've already been there dozens of times...  I was there with the masses on opening night, and I even chose it over Casbah for my graduation (unorthodox, I know).  But my experiences last night pushed me into writing the review.\n\nI showed up with my guy friends who were being a little rowdy, but the service from the hosts, the waitress, and the bartender was excellent.  Our waitress was so nice that she let us keep our table for a full hour after the dining area closed, without complaining.  Of course, once we realized that we were supposed to have moved to the bar by then, we closed our enormous tab with her.  Kudos.  Every time I've been to this Mex, the service has been friendly and fun--the wait staff edges on flirty and likes dress in themes relating to this week's celebrity hot mess (last night was Ke$ha).  It's entertaining.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I'm totally aware that this is not legit Mexican, Tex-Mex, or Cali-Mex.  It's Penna-Mex.  Which I'm totally okay with; it appeals to my bland palate.  I could eat the chicken Mad Mex Quesadilla--the most unoriginality titled item on the menu--every day. \n\nThe beer selection ranges from seasonals (pumpkins, harvests, Oktoberfests) to locals (East End, Penn) to unique (whatever the hot microbrewery of the moment is--Great Lakes, Brooklyn) to the decent standards (Blue Moon).  Recently, I've tried the Brooklyn Oktoberfest and Southern Tier Pumpkin, and I liked both.  The liquor varies from top shelf to bottom of the barrel, and the pours are weak.\n\nThat leaves the margaritas.  Mad Mex Big Azz margs and I go way back to the days of living in South Oakland when we'd sit on my friend's porch across the street and try to figure out the perfect time to show up to take advantage of both the marg special and the half-price student special.  After a summer in Texas, I'm no longer a big fan of the frozen margarita, but I love a good marg on the rocks.  Unfortunately, the Big Azz on the rocks is not something one can drink without furrowed brows and puckered lips.  But, yes, it will get you drunk in a hurry if you can't afford one of the top shelf margs.\n\nThe atmosphere is the best of the Mex here.  It's kitschy.  But the larger bar area and the garage door side make up of the silliness of the decor.\n\nTip: If you go on a weekend, you can use the FREE valet for Casbah across the street (both are owned by Big Burrito).

Their consistency in food quality and service is non-existent at this location.  Jordan and I walk over there at least once-twice a week when we don't want to cook, and we have discovered that the only good time to go and get awesome food, is a busy Saturday night, because that's when the best line cooks and servers are scheduled to work.  If we go on a not-so-busy afternoon or weekday evening, our food sucks, and the service is even worse.  And ordering To Go isn't really a time-saver since the Bartender will ignore you.\n\nI will leave out server and bartender names, just to be polite, but MULTIPLE servers (and I mean MULTIPLE) here, are just the worst in the city.  They're forgetful, slow, and always diffusing responsibility to a faceless kitchen.

Not that I care that people are drunk and/or high - but just be sure you can still function at a basic human level if those are your life choices.  \n\nMy favorite things on the menu are the Angry Hippie Burrito, Foo-Foo Fajitas, and the Tofu Tacos.  Now when we go on a Saturday night - these plates are BANGIN' and totally delicious.  I crave the Tofu Tacos because they're so unique and so filling - whatever that glaze is on the tofu - I can't recreate it at home, unfortunately (and we have TRIED!).  I have to go to Mad Mad to enjoy my Tofu Taco craving.  The Angry Hippie Burrito is freaking awesome too, because it's enormous and there's tons of veggie goodness in it (if it's not overly dominated by black beans).  The Foo-Foo Fajitas - portobello and tofu and a party of other veggies (zucchini, corn, onions, peppers) - just makes love to your face once the skillet passes in front of you.  \n\nThough the wait times are long on weekends, you will mostly likely have a better food and service experience.

{"text": "Ok here goes,\n\nMad Mex is the Tex-Mex offering of the Big Burrito conglomerate of restaurants. As far as Tex-Mex goes, you could do worse. You could do better, but let's just focus on the here and now. \n\nMy girlfriend (a common partner in my culinary escapades) thinks that Mad Mex is,  to quote, \"the shit.\" At the risk of a  sreiously unhappy relationship, I must disagree. I think it is mediocre at best. \n\nWe will start with the atmosphere of the place. It is packed to the walls with new age yuppies each trying to posture as much as possible and show the world how great they are. I don't care, I'm not impressed and neither is anyone else. As as result of everyone in the joint trying to tell the world how great they are, the noise level is a little high for my tastes. Also, after a certain hour, the lights are dimmed to the point where you can barely see your date (a potential plus if you have some evil friends who like blind dates), let alone read the menu. Not that it matters.\n\nThe menu is rather standard fare for Tex-Mex, but it all tastes the same. No matter what you get, it all tastes like spice with a vinegar, pickled backbone. I don't mind spice, hell I like it, but spice should be an accent to the flavor, not the sole player. \n\nMad Mex has a decent beer selection, but it all seems to be kind of run of the mill craft selections. I know that sounds like an oxymoron so let me explain: they do have a fairly healthy variety of decent craft beers, but nothing unique to them. At least at a place like Fat Heads I can get something like Bear Republic Racer 5 on a hand pump. Mad Mex is limited to the standard Dogfishead, Rogue, and Sierra Nevada you see everywhere. As a Tex-Mex place, they do have a nice selection of tequila and their margaritas are \"bomb\" according to my better half.\n\nAs far as service goes, it was borderline, which I don't necessarily consider a bad thing. The servers were friendly and attentive, but not overbearing, which I like. They seemed to grasp the concept that I was there to enjoy my friends' company, not theirs.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a loathsome experience and I will probably be back, if only to satisfy the girlfriend.

One of the first times I visited Pittsburgh before I moved up, my current boyfriend took me by this location for some midday drinking. I was immediately in love.

Once I moved here, this became one of my go to spots to meet with people at - outside of the shitty parking, which isn't their fault. \n\nThey have a good number of beer offerings, though the best part in my opinion is their selection of beers. The craft brews they offer are always on point. And my boyfriend loves their sangrias. He says they do one of the best in town.\n\nLest I forget about the food, I will say that I do enjoy it quite a bit. The carne enchilada with blue cornbread (ooooh, that blue cornbread) is my favorite on the list for sure. And make sure you ask for chips and salsa! Even if I go just for drinks I still end up with chips and salsa.\n\nI don't have any complaints, like I said outside of the parking. During lunch time, it's a real bitch.

{"text": "First of all, the decor in here if offensively bad. It looks like a raging battle between a really crappy tattoo artist and a chic interior decorator, and what makes it worse is how pretentious it seems and how some straight male out there is probably really proud of it.\n\nSecond, the prices are kind of random and ridiculous for certain items. When you come here, don't expect to have a decent meal for less than 20$ once you ad a drink. This in and of itself is a crime to my mind when talking about Mexican food. Especially Tex-Mex. For instance, guacamole by itself cost 1.50 but chips with guacamole cost 7.50. Its good guac, but its not THAT good. And the chips are brutally crappy. I could buy similar quality chips at wal-mart.\n\nI will give them credit for the tacos. I haven't personally tried them because I'm veggie and I don't like tofu, but my friend, who is a foodie, has enjoyed them on numerous occasions and says they're worth the cash. If you have a very good palette and enjoy fine dining but feel like tacos, these are the tacos for you. However, if you're not very discerning and enjoy a good taco stand, don't bother paying the extra for this.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the waitstaff. It isn't that they're terrible. They're just not that great either. They seem distant and disingenuous. Our waiter asked us if our food was good before we even had time to take a bite. The hostess looked positively miserable the entire time we were there and when we tried to eat here once before another hostess sat us in a high-top bar table without even asking if this was acceptable. I've been a hostess before. That, and the cold distant expression are both major party fouls. \n\nMy final complaint is the nachos. They were so bad that I left a comment card expressing my disdain. These people clearly know how to cook or they wouldn't be able to make such good tacos, so, I beg to know, WTF? They were 10$, which is randomly cheap for the amount you get, but when you taste them you might understand why. You get a huge pile of guac and salsa, both of which would be more expensive ordered on their own, and an enormous pile of chips covered in melted monterey jack and black beans. The beans tasted just like the ranch beans you can buy at the grocery and the overall taste really was reminiscent of frito-chilli-pie that you can buy at Sonic. My foodie friend agreed with me on the egregiousness of the whole thing and we left that plate nearly untouched.\n\nTherefore, my advice is, don't go here unless you have a very discerning palette don't mind spending more than is normal for food. If you do go, order the tacos. Do not order anything else. The steak on the tacos actually was medium rare, as asked for, and this was impressive. But if you'd be satisfied with a taco stand, just go to Pizza Sola. Its right down the street and the food is better, and cheaper, and the decor won't make you gag.", "user_id": "J0F2HO_dtCTgeHplR11Deg", "business_id": "JfHCkwm6Efu8ugt7W1fRmw", "stars": 2}

After the ordering debacle, we waited and waited.  After about ten minutes of not seeing our waiter again, I had to pull another waiter over and ask if he could send her our way with our chips and salsa.  Once she decided to grace us with her presence, she stated, \"you didn't order this, I didn't know you wanted it.\"  At this point, I'm getting hot, and it was from the spicy food.\n\nFourth, the food.  I had a chicken, steak and ground beef taco.  Opted for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream and some beans and rice.  Great to mix together.  The chicken was fine.  The steak, a little too well cooked for my liking even though I asked for medium.  And the ground beef, yuck.  It's like they just scraped what was left in bottom of the pan and threw it on a tortilla.\n\nFifth, the price.  For my meal, which should have been free as it was under the $30 limit, I was still charge partly for it.  They only discounted $8 off my check.  Don't get me wrong, I'll pay for my food, I'm not always a cheap bastard, but for the subpar food I just got, with the service that was almost nonexistent, I feel as I should have been compensated for more than $8.\n\nMad Mex, you let me down, badly.  My business can go elsewhere in the Shadyside area now, or maybe that can go for other locations as well.", "user_id": "UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA", "business_id": "JfHCkwm6Efu8ugt7W1fRmw", "stars": 2}

I also ordered a draft.  What I thought was going to start a downhill slip started with this draft.  The one I ordered just happened to kick the keg halfway filling up the glass.  Our server, Caitlin was her name, assured me that they were checking to see if they had another keg, if they did not, she would be back to ask if I wanted anything else.  I was thinking to myself, \"great, here we go again,\" however, she returned with a full glass of my draft, with that, we were over our little hiccup for the evening (another pun).\n\nEverything came out perfect after that.  My Gobblerito was amazing.  Who can argue with Thanksgiving food being stuffed inside a burrito and topped with gravy?  Three good slices of turkey, a serving of stuffing, a serving of mashed potatoes with black beans and some corn stuffed oh so lovingly into a huge burrito.  Top it with a hot serving of gravy, a side of cranberry sauce stuff, and you have your Thanksgiving early.  \n\nMy friends, I must warn y'all, This is a limited time item on their menu.

I got a 12 dollar Don Julio VIP margarita that has an inside out lime floating on top (a floater) and a shot of tequila in it. I got it on the rocks, which I regretted, because the thing was EXTREMELY watered down, almost tasteless. I won't be spending 12 dollars on that again.

Too much, maybe. It's just so conveniently located, the happy hour is good, food is consistent, and most of the staff is very friendly. My history with Mad Mex started at the Oakland location while I was a Pitt undergrad, and once I moved to Point Breeze on the very edge of Shadyside, I was glad that this new location opened within walking distance. The location itself is WAY better than the Oakland restaurant. It's so much bigger, has a cool garage door, and a very large bar.\n\nThe margaritas. Okay, so they're not the best margaritas ever--not even close, really. But the BIg Azz margs are HUGE and are cheap during happy hour. My friends and I actually calculated that getting two Little Butt margaritas at happy hour pricing is a better value that one Big Azz. Two Little Butts will cost $6 for 24 total ounces, while a Big Azz is $7 for 22oz.

{"text": "I came here Saturday evening yesterday and seeing that there were several seats available at the bar I took one and sat down. The bartender approached me and asked me what I would like. I said just a glass of water. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no I'm fine. She gave me a disgruntled look and walked away. Shortly after, another bartender approached me and asked me if I wanted anything and I said I was okay. He said would you like a menu. Feeling a little guilty I agreed to take one but said I ate earlier. He then asked if I had any intention of ordering anything. I said I wasn't sure and then I offered to give up my seat if more people came, after which he then left. I immediately got off my seat and left the establishment.\n\nI can't recall anytime in recent history being treated like that. While I respect the need for establishments to make money and to attract paying customers, it did not sit well with me that I could not even sit down at their bar and relax for a few moments with a drink of water. On plenty of occasions I've gone to other establishments and not been hassled over ordering water. If treated nicely or if the bar was crowded, I would tip when given water or would order something since I do understand their business needs. However, treating a potential customer like a vagrant off the street and not offering any initial hospitality is not a wise business model. This form of treatment makes them feel insulted and not only discourages them from becoming paying customers, but encourages them to write negative reviews and to share their story word of mouth to anyone who will listen.\n\nIf management is so adamant that every person entering their establishment is a paying customer then they must make it into a policy that is clear to incoming patrons. This can be done by putting up signs and also by training personnel to respectfully inform patrons of this policy when they sit at the bar. Digressing, if the bar was crowded and if I continued to order water then I could see their point.\n\nOne other point I should make is that I had just spent $60 at Casbah, the adjacent restaurant, which if I understand correctly, is operated under the same management. Regardless, no incoming patron deserves to be treated like a deadbeat. Any successful business model incorporates courtesy, respect, hospitality, and the crazy notion that any incoming patron has the potential to become a repeat customer if they are treated right. From the treatment I received, I can see that either no such model exists for this establishment, or the hiring or training regimen is in need of some TLC. The experience I had infuriated me and, short of a sincere apology, I will never go back and will share this experience with others.", "user_id": "5z6ZXMg3-XO3UmSxpZWBUA", "business_id": "JfHCkwm6Efu8ugt7W1fRmw", "stars": 1}

{"text": "Four years ago, this Mad Mex was one of the first local restaurants we had tried in Pittsburgh while family was in town. The service had been mediocre, the food was underwhelming, and the margaritas were poor. My margarita was so terrible that I sent it back. (That's the one and only time that I have ever sent a drink back.) I avoided eating at Mad Mex for two years until I gave the Monroeville location a try. After drinking and dining at the Monroeville location multiple times over the last couple years, I fell in love with this local Mexican chain.  \n\nWhile in the middle of some bar hopping last night, my group and I made Mad Mex our last stop. I had such high hopes after our Monroeville experience... but I was disappointed yet again. We started with appetizers which were pretty good. However, our waitress was not the nicest. We arrived at 9:30, and several people at the table ordered beer while I anxiously waited for the Big Azz Margarita special to begin at 10:00. At 9:58, I asked the waitress if it was 10:00 yet, and she curtly answered \"no\" and walked away, not returning for at least 10-15 minutes. I was so frustrated by her that none of us ordered margaritas, and we all ended up leaving the restaurant shortly after. \n\nMy advice would be to drive out to the suburbs and dine at the Mad Mex in Monroeville, where I have consistently had a completely opposite experience.", "user_id": "Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw", "business_id": "JfHCkwm6Efu8ugt7W1fRmw", "stars": 2}

I chose the chicken and waffles, while the BFF chose a burrito. We also got a trio of guacamole, queso, and a salsa to start.\n\nMy chicken and waffles were off the chain amazing. The chicken was boneless and fried and tossed in a delicious spicy sauce. It was served with some agave nectar as well as some cream cheese concoction for dipping. Oh my goodness, it was just so amazing. The spiciness combined with the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese was just out of this world. I devoured my meal.\n\nNow the BFF's burrito was not as good, sadly. To call it a burrito is even a bad choice of words. It was a moist, soggy tortilla that was not rolled in burrito form but simply wrapped around a large mound of mostly rice.

It was just silly how big it was and the rice distracted from the other ingredients. \n\nAs I looked around, I saw a few other pairs of diners in which one got chicken and waffles, and the other got a burrito.

{"text": "Overview:\nMad Mex is a popular, dimly lit, trendy Mexican restaurant/bar on S Highland Ave pretty close to the plaza with Chipotle/Whole Foods that I visited as a part of a large group for a pre-interview dinner.\n\nThe Food:\nPerhaps I am not the best person to talk about the food here because we did not have a traditional meal here. We were served buffet, BYOT (build-your-own-taco) style, and given a standard array of chicken, lettuce, salsas, and soft tortillas. We were served on their second story dining table which is basically a indoor balcony that seats a little over 20 people. I didn't find the food to be very special in any way, and thought the open room wasn't the best place for people to talk due to noise from the bottom stories.\n\nThe Establishment:\nSituated on a row of shops rather than in a plaza, I'm not exactly sure where people park. When I came here, I ended up parking in the Whole Foods plaza which was about a quarter mile away. It's very dimly lit, and fairly loud, but was upscale in that most of the furniture was good heavy wood and the bathrooms were classy and clean. There is a large bar to your left as you enter that I did not try out.\n\nThe Service:\nI can't really comment as I came with a large private group. After our initial drink orders, I didn't meet a waiter again.\n\nConclusions:\nMad Mex was a decent restaurant for our large group (~20 people) but unfortunately I was not impressed by the food. I do have to warn readers that my experience was likely marred because buffet-style food has to appeal to the broadest audience and I do favor adventurous places that take chances with their cooking.

It was also overcooked so it was just kind of like dried cheese on some chips with lots of cheese-less chips. The other toppings were okay but nothing amazing. The burrito was really sad. It looked like a square on the plate, not like any burrito I've ever seen before. The filling was almost entirely rice, which was okay tasting by itself, but there was way too much in the burrito. The carnitas were extremely salty to the point that I didn't even finish the meat. There were a few trace amounts of green in the bottom of the tortilla (I guess that was the advertised \"green chile\"), but they had almost no flavor or spice so it was hard to distinguish them.

{"text": "I love the convenience of Mad Mex, and the spacious-ness of the restaurant. Very rarely have I had to come here and wait for a table, unlike the Oakland Mad Mex, where I practically had to wait every time I dine there. \n\nI really love the margaritas here. If you go during happy hour (4:30-6:30 p.m.), you can get their 22 oz Big Azz Margaritas. I get mango or strawberry, it is a light fruity drink with just the right amount of tequila. I get pretty buzzed after drinking one, so I'm glad I'm a five minute walk from here.\n\nTheir food is great, but I think out of everything I have tried here, I really like ....the nachos. Yea. I mean, the burrito is good, and fajitas are nice, but they aren't nachos. When I eat the nachos, I feel like I am eating a perfect harmony of textures, flavors, and toppings. When I eat the burrito or the fajitas, the meat flavor falls a little short and is sometimes bland. The guac and sour cream add something to it, but I want to eat a burrito where I don't need to smother it with guac to add flavor, you know? \n\nAnyway, while I have my gripes on their select food items, I will probably frequent this place for as long as their happy hour exists.

{"text": "Let's just say when people ask me (Miss Yelp! Elite) what my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant is I don't hesitate to say Mad Mex.  In fact, Mad Mex has been my favorite for a good twenty years when the Atwood Street location in Oakland was the only one.  Now you can find a Mad Mex in several locations, and the one I'm reviewing is for the Shady Avenue, Shadyside, spot.\nI can't rave enough on the layout and design of this space.  Large bar in the middle with high tops surrounding it, huge garage door wall that is open as soon as the weather beats 60 degrees, sidewalk seating, inside booths, and a loft area with addition seating so you can peer down at all the cool kids hanging at the bar.  Phenomenal Mexican artwork largely displayed on the wall, awesome mason jars with green lights hung by rope decorating the bar and awesome wooden beams and floors.  You want to feel like you've gone somewhere cool?  Then come inside and enjoy.\nI've ordered several different options from the menu - favorites being the fried tofu appetizer, the \"pick-a-dilla\" dips and tortilla (pick three dips - and always make guacamole one of those choices!), the Mad Mex Burrito, and the shrimp quesadillas.  All a ten on the yum-o scale.\nDon't even get me started on their margaritas.  They're all delicious and the flavors change often with the seasons. For example, come in the fall and order an apple cider margarita, or stop by in the summer for a blackberry margarita...you get the drift.  \nExcellent selection of craft brews on tap including killer IPA options.  And, when the clock strikes fall, you can get Pumking on tap.  Hail Mad Mex!", "user_id": "lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ", "business_id": "JfHCkwm6Efu8ugt7W1fRmw", "stars": 5}
{"text": "I really like this place. Out of all the locations, I do like this one the best. Large bar area, some outdoor and partial outdoor seating. Upstairs tier as well. \nGreat beer selection. Multiple crafts of tap and bottle selection. Margaritas: this is probably the only place I get a margarita. Ever since college when Tequila and I broke up, I have steered clear from even the margarita. Mad Mex makes a great one. Seasonal ones are pricey. Stick to the classic. \nFood. I love their chips and salsa.  That the best part of the meal as far as I'm concerned. You can also get this to go which is typically a hit for the on the go party appetizer. The trio dip app is worth it. Definitely get the guac. It's great. \nEvery burrito I've had has been awesome. I'm partial to the fajita one. As of late I've been on to the mahi tacos. Fresh, and a little lighter than the burritos. Last time I asked for no rice and they LOADED me up with black beans to sub. Great to not skimp on that. The black beans are lovely, too. You can also get the burritos in a bowl. \nThe Pennsyltucky tofu app is pretty damn delicious. \nNow...the must is the Gobbblerito at Thanksgiving (and occasionally in the summer or craft beer week by surprise.) Why does Thanksgiving dinner taste so good in a burrito? Because it does. \nThey also have awesome mail coupons and free entree for your birthday if you sign up.

{"text": "After many months of waiting for a restaurant to take the space at the bottom of the Glass Lofts(and then many more for it to actually be constructed!), Verde has finally had a soft opening to the public. Why soft? The way I understand it, not of all their alcohol is in yet. Regardless, I will review it as such, and take the service into account as little as possible - the star rating does not reflect the service, and I will put service related comments in a section at the end.\n\nWe arrived for our 7:00 reservations and were seated immediately, the restaurant was just under half full and the bar was just over three quarters full. We were seated at a small two-person table(I hate those damn things) , and given brand-spanking-new menus. The right-hand side of the menu is the beverages: 4 or 5 margaritas from $6-8, a handful of craft cocktails for $10, tequilas running the gamut from $4 to $54 for a shot, beers for $5, and standard mexican N/A drinks. I loved this part of the menu because while I don't care much for margaritas, and I'm not much for tequila, they do offer several different tasting flights that are fairly affordable. These range in price from about 7 to 11 and offer trios by style or by brand. The tequilas are also served with a shot of Sangrita - a delicious concoction that goes perfectly with tequila and tastes kind of like a bloody mary but without crappy tabasco flavor.\n\nThe left hand of the menu offers about 8 appetizers($4-$10), most involving chips, soups and salads(~$8), entrees($14-$20), and tacos($4-$6/ea). While the appetizers and salads had several veggie options, there were only two entrees(and no tacos) that fell into the category. Regardless, the vegetarian items were marked, so that gets points.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a 'Spicy Honey BBQ' margarita, while I opted for the 'Tequila 101' flight(one blanco, one reposado, and one anejo). We also got the fried plantains with chipotle aioli as a starter, and I got the chicken mole while she got the mushroom enchiladas. Her margarita, while it had a tasty aftertaste, had a bit too much lime for me - but I she enjoyed it. My tequila was fairly self-explanatory, but I love the concept of the flight. It really lets you enjoy their differences-the smells, the tastes, the burns, etc- all at once, and allows you a better appreciation for their differences.\n\nChips and salsa came first, and they were awesome. Not a lot of cilantro in the salsa(I hate cilantro) and the chips tasted fresh. When the plantains arrived, their presentation was wonderful, placed on a banana leaf, but unfortunately I found that they were too thick to really enjoy. The flavor of the sauce and the cotija was excellent, but it was quickly lost while the thick, starchy plantain persisted.\n\nOur mains arrived, mine over fries made of Yucca and hers with red rice and black beans on the side. I found her rice and beans to be wonderful - especially the strong tomato and pepper flavor in the rice, but again my Yucca was too thick and starchy to eat even the modest serving that accompanied my dish. My girlfriend said that her enchiladas were excellent as far as flavor goes, but they were fairly small and for only two of them, she felt the value wasn't quite there for a vegetarian dish. My chicken on the other hand was a fairly sizable porton and extremely well cooked - my only complaint being that I'd love more mole with it. Also, being still on the bone made it a bit difficult to eat in this kind of restaurant.\n\nThe desserts sounded good, but we opted out. Our waitress urged us to try the sorbet when we returned. Verde is a good option, and nice to see some mexican food in the area that isn't simply burritos. As we exited, the table next to us was served a chili relleno that, if it tasted as good as it looked, could have earned another star easily. Sadly, though for the price and the quality, I feel that it would be hard for us to make the decision to walk past salt to eat here. As a bar lounge, I think Verde excels, but as a restaurant, I think it falls a bit short. I will gladly return in a few months to give them another chance, though\n\nAlso I'd be doing them a disservice if I failed to mention the free wifi and extra outlets in the restaurant. Chips, salsa, a drink, and a laptop could turn this place into an excellent spot to work through lunch.\n\n-----\n\nService: The service was poor, even for an opening night. In the two hours(!) it took us to get our food, our waitress only spoke to us about 3 times(At no point did they mention the wait, ask us to bear with them, etc). Worse though, in start contrast to the image they portray through their social media presence, the service was stiff and as formal as they could try and be - it came off as inauthentic in my opinion. Again, I won't dwell on the service issues because it was opening night - I'm sure they'll be ironed out quickly.", "user_id": "_ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Verde lives up to the buzz!  \n\nI've been there twice now in the past two weeks - once for a private pre-opening event and again last night for a work-dinner function.  While both visits were  during Verde's 'soft launch,' I thought it was excellent!  The food was very tasty, the staff was very nice, and the ambiance was alive! \n\nThe chicken tacos had great flavor and I heard similar comments from my colleagues who tried the sweet potato tacos.  I would HIGHLY recommend Chef LBEE's signature corn shrimp fritters for the appetizer and the tres leche bread pudding for dessert - simply mouth watering!\n\nJeff Catalina, the owner, also gave us a personal 'tour' of their tequila selection - very impressive, to say the least!  Having been to Tequila, Mexico and toured the Jose Cuervo factory, my eyes were immediately drawn to the top shelf and the unopened bottle La Reserva de Familia (The Family Reserve).  This is an outstanding sipping tequila with strong body and a smokey finish.  I would recommend as a great after-dinner drink.  \n\nI have been looking for a place that stocks this tequila - glad that Verde has included it in their regular stock - I'll be returning just for this, for sure!\n\nHere's a little fun fact for you ... when you are sitting down near the bar, have a look up at the ceiling.  What appears to be a hodgepodge of dangling and angled finished wooden boards, are actually a collage of the leaves making up an agave plant.  It stretches from the corner of the restaurant and fans out into the dining room area!  Nice touch!\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Verde to anyone looking for a new spin on Mexican in the burgh.

{"text": "Got a chance to check this place out on Saturday and it was actually the first time I had even heard of it.  They were still in their \"soft opening\" phase so based on my personal experience they have a few kinks to work out.  \n\nThis place could have easily received 1 star were it not for their save at the end of the night.  So here's an account of the experience.\n\nOur group had 5 people and the tables were completely reserved for the night so we were lucky to find place at the bar.  No worries - we can adapt.  \n\nWe put in our drink orders, I had the white sangria - it was ok, I've had better, and I think the waitress was having trouble with what was supposed to go into it b/c she kept reading the ingredients from the menu which was worrying me a bit.  But whatevs, it's alcohol and it wasn't undrinkable.  \n\nThen we put in our appetizer order and entree orders all at once.  The appetizers came out in a timely fashion.  \n\nAs an appetizer we got chips and all their types of salsa and I got to try the guac.  The chips were hit or miss, there were some chips that were soggy b/c they weren't cooked through and some that were cooked to perfection.  I was trying to get a system in place to figure out which chips were crispy before diving in - no luck - it seemed to be random.  Well I will say the white chips had a higher probability of being soggy than the yellow chips.\n\nThe salsa in the order that I enjoyed them was salsa fresca, spicy chipotle, and then the green tomatillo salsa.  I was really disappointed int he guacamole - it was missing a kick.  We discussed and came to the conclusion that it needed more lime and cilantro - I'd be all for adding in more spice!\n\nWe ordered the elotes (char-grilled corn) - it's about 1/2 a piece of corn on the cob served on a skewer with some sauce and other good stuff on it.  Talk about delish!  It was a high point in the evening.\n\nSo now for the swift decline...there was about 1 1/2 - 2 hours between when we got our appetizer to when we got the entrees we ordered.  I'm not exactly sure what was happening b/c we mentioned it a few times and it seemed like they were confused as well.  Lucky for us none of us were ravenously hungry, but talk about ridiculous.  On top of that our waitress at the bar seemed disinterested in us.  She was all talk and smiles with the couple next to us, but when our group asked questions or wanted to know information about the specials during the week - she just seemed indifferent or wouldn't really provide us with relevant information.  It was weird.  \n\nI ordered the Chiles Rellenos as an entree and although it took forever to come out, the taste was fantastic.  \n\nDue to the lackluster service and the epic wait between apps and entrees, I was ready to write this place off and throw a token 1-star rating its way.  But when it was time to get our check and head out we were told that they'd take care of it and that they apologize for the wait and that it's been comped.  \n\nThis is where I felt like they came through.  A restaurant isn't only about great food, it's about great service as well.  And it was fair to at least take care of our entrees b/c of the wait but the fact that they took care of the apps and drinks was definitely a plus and helped redeem Verde at the end of the night.\n\nI hope that when they legitimately open they take care of all these issues b/c fool me once shame on me, fool me twice, I'm not coming back.", "user_id": "D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 4}
{"text": "I really really believe this place can be great!  It has all the right things in place.  Gorgeous restaurant, delicious looking menu and almost 150 different tequila's on tap (hooooollllaaaa!!!).  \n\nThis is their \"soft opening\" week, which was marked on their menu (smart, right?!) so I felt like I could give them some grace.  I've worked in restaurants before, I've actually opened one as server once, so I know there's ebbs and flows to the start of a business.  \n\nLet's start with the drinks!  I thought my drink was awesome!  Really well made actually (with great tequila's to boot!).  I ftried the Baja Eden, which is a passion fruit and pomegranate margarita.  It was served in a wine glass and when it was presented to me (beautifully, with a tiny edible flower inside) I almost gasped.  It was not very full.  Like, not at all.  BUT, when I looked over at my friends full glass of marg and ice, I realized it probably equaled out to be the same.  But once I tasted it, I forgot how small it was, because it was INCREDIBLE!  I would absolutely suggest this! \n\nFood wise, I thought everything was very tasty.  I love the fresh chips and....let me say a little somethin' somethin' about the salsa.  I'm a HUGE salsa fan.  I love chunky tomato salsa.  I hate runny salsa.  I had fruity salsa.  I haven't had many different salsa's I enjoyed actually.  The roasted green tomatillo salsa they serve was awesome!  I could have drank it, it was that good!  We also ordered the gauc, hearing a rumor it was made right at your table.  It is not made at the table, but I do suspect it's fresh.  I wanted a little more kick to my gauc, but it wasn't bad at all.\n\nFor the entree, my friend and I split the Enchiladas De Verduras.  You could absolutely taste the smoked veggies of swiss chard, tomato, mushrooms and caramelized onions.  It also had cheesy queso sauce and salsa roja.  The ONLY thing that was wrong with my meal was the soft taco was pretty soft....soggy actually.  It didn't deter me from eating it, because it was delish....but maybe a little less sauce?  \n\nThe service was lacking.  Again, I understand it's a soft opening, so I won't go into details.  But i can only assume (HOPE!) they'll get that together asap! For how much detail went into everything here, I'm assuming they want to be around for a while!\n\nI'm very excited to come back on Wednesdays, where every Tequila under $18 is $3 for a tasting.  Not bad to try a bunch of different kinds!  They also offer different Tequila flights that I'm excited to try out.  I have pretty much decided I will become a tila expert by mid winter!

{"text": "Okay, let me start out by saying the food and drinks are definitely 5-star worthy. The service is not. As everyone is saying, I hope and expect it to improve quickly (I was there the opening night) or I will be very disappointed.\n\nPros:\nSANGRITA! I could drink this stuff all day, it's amazing. Really.\nChips and salsa - dig the tomatilla\nTequila flights - good selections and inexpensive\nMargaritas - some really creative ones there, I got honey BBQ\nFlavors - I ordered the enchiladas de verduras, and it was probably one of the best enchiladas of my life, no lie!\n\nCons:\nAn HOUR AND A HALF wait between the appetizer and entree\nThe entree was way too small for $15, regardless of the taste. And it was served lukewarm instead of hot, after an hour and a half wait.\nBeer list - I get that it's a tequila bar, so I find this acceptable. Still a bad list though.\nThe staff...\n\nProbably the most disappointing aspect was the complete lack of interest in the wait staff and bartenders. Not once did anyone mention that it was the opening night, to please excuse the wait, to ask what we thought (really??), or even \"how is everything?\" but instead was only asked \"would you like another drink?\" I was expecting some more spunk and personality from the staff but was sadly received with some kind of fake peppiness and a total disregard for us for a full hour while we waited for the food. No apologies, no excuses, no explanations, just asks for refills on our margaritas. I wish someone would have asked what we thought, because it would make me more confident that some of these problems would be ironed out.\n\nRegardless, I WILL be returning here, and if the service stays slow and the food doesn't totally meet it's mark, I'll still be back for drinks and chips here, for sure. The food isn't cheap so I can't see the prices justified as long as the wait is slow and the staff is inattentive.

{"text": "We were very excited to try Verde.  But after reading the reviews, we were also a bit afraid.  I don't want to spend an hour anywhere waiting for my meal.  \n\nWe decided it was best to go with a 5 o'clock reservation.  We were seated right away by a window in front.  After about 5 seconds I was freezing, so we asked to be moved to the back wall banquet.\n\nBJ got a Great Lakes Xmas ale and I got a Baja Eden margarita at the recommendation of our super perky server Squidgette.  \"It's sweet and delicious and the presentation is beautiful.  It's served in a wine glass with a beautiful flower\".  It was a concoction of passion fruit and pomegranate.  While yummy,  I was expecting more volume than a 1/2 inch in the bottom of my glass.  Keep your orchid blossom, I want alcohol. \n\nFirst up was the green tomatillo salsa and chips.  Some of the chips were a little greasy, but we managed to clean them right up.  We also got a side of guacamole which was decent, just a little bland.  We also shared the elotes appetizer, which was very good.  But my bf laughed about paying $5 for a cob of corn.  Moving on to our meals....\n\nBJ got the tacos de pescado.  The fish of the day was mahi mahi.  He thought the tacos were nice and so were the accompanying red rice and black beans.  I inquired about the pozole verde and was advised that the serving size was 20 ounces, (yes, I am checking on portion sizes from now on after the smidgen of margarita I received).  My stew was packed full of delicious pork, but I thought the hominy was a bit over cooked.  I also could not finish the entire serving.  Wish I could say that about my margarita!\n\nWe always like dessert.  I mean I always like dessert and BJ is kind enough to share.  We opted for the tres leches bread pudding.  I thought it was yummy, but BJ could only taste 2 leches.  Ha ha.   I thought it could have benefited from some fresh fruit, maybe a sliced strawberry or a couple blueberries on the side.  Tres leches is always served with fresh fruit.  Raisins don't cut it.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice meal.

{"text": "All flash and no bang.\n\nDon't let the trendy decor, soft music, low lighting, and fanciful presentation fool you, Verde's food and service just doesn't deliver.\n\nThe chips and salsa were pretty tasty, so when the chicken tacos and chiles rellenos came out with stellar presentation, I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed to pieces on the first bite.  Both dishes were bland and uninspired.  All I could taste in the chiles rellenos were the rice and pepper--everything else was lost.  The chicken tacos seemed like they should have been amazing, but when you close your eyes and take a bite, you may be met with disappointment.\n\nWe also tried the queso fundido.  It tasted pretty good, but we were served a skillet of the queso, a stack of hot tortillas, and nothing else.  All fine, except we didn't have any plates to put them on.  Therefore, we were left trying to figure out where to put these things down while we ate.  Awkward.\n\nAs other reviewers also mentioned, the service here was really lacking.  Here are just a few things that didn't go quite right: Our (original?) waitress seemed completely disinterested, we never heard the specials (even though I overheard another table getting the run-down), no one ever asked how our food was, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink, we had to ask to get our water refilled after they were empty for about 30 minutes, and our waitress disappeared after the first 20 minutes.  Finally, a male waiter was the one who finished serving our table, but no explanation was given that a change had taken place or what was going on.\n\nAs another random aside, in the bathroom, there was a tissue box with no tissues (obviously they knew they were out, but didn't refill).  The paper towel dispenser was \"touch\" only and didn't seem to work (no way to manually dispense paper towels).\n\nAll things considered, I was really disappointed.

We did not get seated until after 10pm!!!! I'm sorry but that's a bit ridiculous. Someone there either doesn't know how to count tables or take reservations. What's the point of having a reservation if you don't get seated until 2 hours later? \n\nThe drinks were pretty good but expensive. I had a Mojito and Caipirinha. Both were about $10-$11 per drink but I think they were tasty, so whatever. So we FINALLY get our table and it's almost another hour when we finally get our food. I believe in enjoying dinner and making the most of it but arriving at 7:45pm and not leaving until after 11pm is a bit much!!! The food was not worth the price. I had chicken enchiladas that were $18. They were 2 of the smallest and blandest enchiladas that I've ever had. The very small side of beans and rice were also bland. I was not happy about the food at all especially with the long wait and high price. \n\nI don't think I'll be back to visit. It may be new and it may be hip and trendy but it's not worth it to me.

{"text": "Verde is an upscale Mexican/South American restaurant with a slightly edgy vibe in the Glass Lofts along the Penn Ave corridor between Garfield and Friendship/Bloomfield. \n\nThe food, drinks, and service were very good, even though we visited during the soft opening. We went on a weeknight (the Tuesday before Thanksgiving), so it wasn't crowded and we didn't have any seating/service issues. Food-wise, everyone at our table was surprised by the novel options available on the menu. The food is not the traditional heavy rice and beans Mexican fare found in the Northeast. It is substantially more sophisticated in its preparation and is much lighter on the stomach. The chicken mole, for example, is not drowning in sauce or swimming in rice. It's still hearty though. Everything we ordered was good or very good. The guacamole, made freshly at the table, even impressed all the Californians in our party. The cocktails were tasty  and creative; definitely try the Tequila Old Fashioned if you enjoy the traditional version. \n\nThe atmosphere in the dining area is more cheerful and social than romantic. If you like eating at a bar or having drinks and watching the game, it seems fun as well; there are a few HDTV's and an entire wall of Tequilas. Some cocktail tables separate the dining area from the bar, and there is a patio with a few chairs and tables. My impression is that it's less focused on having a legitimate bar than on having a place for people to have drinks while they wait for a table, but this might change in the summer when the garage doors can be left open. Ali the bartender is very, very good. If you want try something new, just give her a general idea of what you are looking for.\n\nI would come here with friends or a spouse to begin/or during a night out.

Almost everything else was bad.\n\nThey had taken reservations on almost all of their tables (Friday, ~8PM).  Trouble was that walk-ins didn't have any place to go, so they doubled up at the bar a bit.  The bar stayed completely full, while tables were 3/4s full; the bar got *pounded*, and if a bartender tried to take a (deserved!) break, service got much worse.\n\nI asked for \"no cheese\", as it doesn't agree with me.  That narrowed me down to two choices; the rest of the menu had cheese, and it might be pre-prepared, since they couldn't do it without cheese.  The girl next to us at the bar wanted a corn tortilla, and they were out.  These seem like weird issues to me.  I know some things are prepared ahead of time, but \"no cheese\" is usually easy, and running out of a shelf-stable staple is odd.\n\nThe tacos (chorizo?) were possibly the tastiest thing I've ever had in a mexican restaurant.  They also were one of the two no-cheese options I had.\n\nOther than tacos, the food was bad.  Guacamole, salsa, flautas, all had absolutely no salt, and very, very little spicing.  They tasted completely dead until we asked for a salt shaker and fixed it a bit.  The soup was an exception; so salty it was nearly inedible.  My best guess was that the kitchen isn't tasting any of the food, or the manager isn't trying any of the dishes, or something.  This was really surprisingly bad, as this isn't hard.\n\n\nThe mixed drinks/specialty drinks were phenomenal.  Kept ordering different things, and they were *all* good.

{"text": "The partner and I went last night, and we had a great time! \n\nMonday nights seem to be a good time for visiting new(ish) restaurants, we had great service from the hostess, server(s) and manager.\n\nOn to the food! The chips were outstanding! I'm guessing double fried, I don't have high standards but I couldn't stop munching on these. As others have mentioned, the roasted tomatillo salsa was outstanding, something I would expect to pay extra for at most restaurants.\n\nThe menu consisted of 5-6 appetizers $8-12, 2-4 soups and salads $8-11 and about 8 main entrees from $11-30. There were ample vegetarian options and last night there seemed to be a lot of fish on the menu. Also, I'm by no means an expert on the subject, but the menu struck me as not tex-mex but more something Rick Bayless would put together.\n\nI had the chile rellenos de (something or other). WOW! These poblanos were SPICY, but manageable, over some awesome white & black rice with loads of perfectly wood grilled veggies (including grilled fennel bulb, yum!) surrounding the plate. The sauce was super smoky and savory. Also glad that these were not fried.\n\nMy partner had the enchiladas de verduras, as others have mentioned, and we were a big fan. Maybe they have changed it up a bit, but they were just oozing with smokey chard cheesey goodness with another roasted sauce that I would aspire to at home.\n\nThere's a wall full of tequila, you can imagine what that is used for, 8 or 10 draft selections, and a somewhat paltry wine list. I went with the Big Hop.\n\nOverall, it seems like everything is either smoked, grilled or roasted... and I'm super down with that. We were very pleased, but just felt like the menu was about 25% pricier than we had hoped.

{"text": "Have you ever had great tequila?  For many people (and myself included) that answer is no.  When I think of tequila, it's of random shots in random bars with lime and salt all over my hand.  However, tequila can be so much more than that.  Like any spirit that exists (or pretty much any vice that exists), tequila can run to the very high end with extraordinary complexity.  \n\nVerde is a new upscale Mexican place just a few doors up from the very popular Salt of the Earth.  However, it's a Mexican restaurant somewhat in disguise.  What it really is is a temple to tequila.  When it comes to the blue agave spirit from the highlands of Jalisco, these guys mean business.\n\nVerde has far and away the biggest selection of tequila in the Burgh, as well as other Mexican spirits.  They're extremely knowledgeable about such spirits.  They literally offer about 30 different tequila flights that include both the blanco (pure and not aged) the reposado (aged) and anejo (really aged) versions of a variety of tequilas.  They also have tequila infusions and mescal.  Each is about a quarter-shot served on a small wooden paddle with a 4th well of sangrita (a non-alcoholic spicy tomato palate-cleanser beverage).  They also hand you an iPad with pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about tequila.  The whole \"tablet computer to show off our liquor selection\" is not original (ex. Aureole in Vegas), but it is a very novel thing for the Burgh.  \n\nThe gentleman who served the flights (tequila sommelier?) was extremely knowledgeable about tequila and clearly passionate about this particular spirit.  It was really fun hearing everything he had to teach us.  I've never met anyone in my life who knew more about tequila and his passion clearly showed in the presentation.\n\nOverall, I was really excited to see such a unique and niche place open in Pittsburgh.  When it comes to Mexican, this place is a million times more serious than Mad Mex.  Although it has tremendous potential, the food left a bit to be desired.  My chicken with house-made mole sauce was dry.  Dry chicken is an inexcusable mistake in the finer dining world that Verde is hoping to inhabit.  There was also an overuse of the Yucca fries as it appeared both in our ceviche and my entree.  Neither preparation had any flavor.\n\nVerde is on the right track by trying to elevate our sense of tequila and Mexican spirits.  However, that ambition is the only reason that I'm giving them 3 stars versus 2.  The food just isn't there yet.  Competition has gotten stiff in the Burgh and you can't just roll out whatever anymore and expect people to flock to it.  Amazing chefs like Rick Bayless have proved that Mexican cuisine can be elevated to a very high level.  Verde has a long, long way to reach the heights of Frontera Grill or Topolobampo.  I think they have the potential to get there.  They clearly have a tremendous passion for Mexican spirits so I hope they will continue to strive to elevate their menu to the same level.", "user_id": "dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Eight of us went to Verde back in December to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We'd all heard great things and were really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love this place, I can't recommend it to others. \n\nFirst, the service was absolutely terrible.  We had an early-ish reservation on a Saturday night and when we arrived the restaurant was a little less than 50% full.  After we all trickled in and had a drink at the bar, we were seated at our table.  After about 20 minutes with no waiter greeting us or taking a drink order, we finally got up and asked someone who appeared to be the manager if he could help us.   He was very nice and had a waiter attend to us right away.  Rather than be apologetic, this waiter proceeded to have a attitude with us all night.  \n\nWe finally ordered a few pitchers of drinks that came out very slowly, one by one.  Pitchers were initially dropped off without enough glasses for everyone and we had to get up and ask the manager-guy for help again.  The same happened when we ordered our food -- it trickled out slowly, with some people nearly finishing their meals before the last plate was delivered.  The service was truly terrible, so I'll stop here, but really could go on quite a while with many additional examples.\n\nThe food and drink menu was truly amazing and we all couldn't wait to eat.  The drinks were all delicious.  The general feeling around the table is that the food was all over salted but still okay, with one exception:  Three of us ordered the Enchiladas de Verduras -- a vegetarian enchilada made with swiss chard and a variety of other veggies.  Although the flavor was delicious, we were all convinced that the kitchen had forgotten to wash the swiss chard.  With every bite, we were grinding sand or dirt or something in our teeth -- kind of like what happens when you eat a sandwich at the beach on a windy day.  Although I tried to ignore it, I finally had to give up on my meal.  The same is true for my two other friends.  When we mentioned it to the waiter, he shrugged and said he'd mention it to the kitchen.  Although all three of our meals were only partially eaten, he did not offer to remove from our bill or bring a free alternative.\n\nI wish I'd loved this place because the menu was amazing, but I can't in good conscious recommend given my experience.", "user_id": "6iqY4ZLlPsi0bZZgAFZ_CA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 2}

They opened! The decor is very attractive and the food is good, but the service is horrendous.  I mean, it's truly just plain bad.  And unapologetically so.  While there as a party of four, they admitted that they forgot to seat us and left us lingering at the bar for about 45 minutes, even though we had a reservation, and then once seated, didn't bring us water and chips for another 10 minutes.  It took another ten or so for someone to take our drink orders, and so on and so forth.  Our server didn't bring a second order of chips until we asked four times and then forgot the salsa, which he never brought even though we reminded him.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't taken so so long to get served our food.  We just started flagging down anyone we saw to ask them to get our waiter's attention. It also took some major pleading to get drink refills, get our check, and pay our bill. A really frustrating and loooong dining experience.  Even though the food is good (and the grilled corn is super good) I won't be going back until I read that service has markedly increased.

{"text": "I went with a group last night and we had a great meal. I'd been looking forward to trying this place since meeting the owner last year when his house was on the South Side House Tour and he said he was about to open a new restaurant that would feature authentic Mexican food. I wasn't disappointed. This isn't your typical smothered-in-cheese-and-jarred-salsa place.\n\nThe complimentary chips and tomatillo salsa are delicious. We got a guacamole appetizer for the table. It's a generously-sized portion that is incredibly fresh with lots of chunky avocado. For entrees, I shared the chick pea & camote tacos and grilled chicken tacos with a friend. I found the camote ones a bit dry, but the chicken ones were very juicy and tasty, and most importantly, the chicken tasted like it had actually been cooked on a grill as opposed to just having been branded with a grill marks iron. I tasted a friend's chiles rellenos and thought it was very good too. \n\nThey have a choice of 3 desserts, and between us we tried all of them. They are all good, and each one meets a different need: the sorbet is light and refreshing, the tres leches bread pudding is warm and comfy, and the flourless chocolate cake is rich, dense and truffle-like.\n\nWhile everything was good, I might rate the appetizers and desserts a bit higher than the entrees. Next time I might make a meal of all the salsa varieties and guac and then dessert. Or I might try the carne asada, as another reviewer here made that sound very tempting.

{"text": "Oh, Verde! You had me at first bite!\n\nMy meal started out with a palate cleanser - a shot glass filled with a concoction of pomegranate, lime, and other juices, topped with a strong kick of pepper. Chips and a fresh green salsa were provided on the house, while I ordered the Elotes as an appetizer. The Elotes, albeit a simple snack, was far and above the highlight of the meal. Grilled corn on the cob drizzled in lime aioli and a smattering of spices and cheese = ABSOLUTE HEAVEN. Who would've known to combine all these ingredients?! (Not me - but then again, maybe that's why I don't run a restaurant, eh?)\n\nI moved on to the main course - Enchiladas de Verduras (the vegetarian enchiladas). Incredibly fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection, though not the most novel combination here. I don't even LIKE swiss chard, but it tasted fantastic in this context. I admit, the Tacos de Camote sounded a bit more exciting, but I guess I'll just have to save that one for next time. Mad props for all the veggie-friendly stuff on the menu!\n\nI ended my night with the Tres Leches Bread Pudding, which was just melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Again, not a fan of raisins, but I ate them all here! (Sure, it might've helped that they were drowning in sugar/butter/cream...) It was served piping hot and heavily steeped in the traditional tres leches glaze, topped with a dollop of rapidly-melting whipped cream. Definitely give this a try if (by \"if\", I mean \"when\") you stop in!\n\nService was exceptional. My glass was never half-empty (coming from a pessimist) and dishes were removed immediately upon finishing the food atop them.\n\nNext time, I'll prepare to come hungry *and* thirsty, so I can give their infamous tequila collection a good run!", "user_id": "b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 5}
{"text": "I was hesitant to eat here after all the mixed reviews, but I was SO pleasantly surprised. Maybe they just needed some time to get their act together, so if you visited when they first opened, it might be worth another shot.\n\nFirst off, the chips and salsa are free (yes!) and the salsa verde is delicious! I am not a salsa fan but I couldn't stop eating (drinking) it! We also got some guacamole and it was pretty good, although I wish it had more garlic (then again, I can do more garlic on literally anything). Both my friend and I got tacos--I got carne asada and she got pescado--and they were pretty perfect. They were big so they were a little messy to eat (probably not first date material...awk), but the flavors were awesome. Also, I asked for my meat to be cooked on the rarer side, and they managed to get some red in those little fajita strips. I like that they listened to me!\n\nIt is excrutiatingly difficult to choose a drink here because literally all of the options sound incredible. I chose two--the Walnut Street margarita (walnut/maple) and the Winterberry margarita (cranberry/honey/apple). They were interesting, in a good way. Our server dissuaded me from ordering the Honey BBQ margarita, which by his description, was like drinking a bag of BBQ Ruffles. While that sounds kind of disgustingly amazing, I had a bloody mary earlier in the week and decided my savory-drink quota had been filled. I definitely need to go back and try this BBQ concoction though. I'm intrigued.\n\nIn case you didn't read any other reviews, THEY HAVE A MILLION TEQUILAS! I'm not a tequila girl but the bottles looked awfully pretty lined up behind the bar!\n\nAfter we ate, we hung out at the bar with a friend and it was a really chill environment.

It's cool to see a good drinking spot in Garfield (Salt being pretty expensive if you wanna do some serious drinking, your only other real option is Penn-Aiken Dairy...). In general, I really like the atmosphere here. It's pretty comparable to Salt's--trendy, upscale, yet comfortable. Not stuffy.

{"text": "I REALLY wanted to like this place.  I had heard about it months before it opened.  I waited in anticipation as they passed their soft opening, and were up and established.  Finally on the day of my birthday, I decided to finally try it out.  I salivated over the menu.  DH & I finally decided on a few appetizers and sharing an entree.  I ordered one of their specialty cocktails - it was so hard to choose!  They used very interesting ingredients, I wanted to try them all!  I started off with a Baja Eden that had passion fruit, pomegranate mixed with a delicious tequila.  It was divine..... served with a beautiful flower.  Next up we ordered two appetizers: Ceviche del dia (shrimp & scallops) & Chicken Flautas: Fried tortillas, smoked chicken, poblano slaw, crema.  The Ceviche was OK.  It didn't have a fresh taste to it, and the spices were way off.  It almost tasted like spices from a packet.  The flautas on the other hand were delicious!  The smokey flavor along with the fresh crema were spot on.  The appetizers were pretty sizable so we ended up sharing an entree, the enchiladas de pollo.  They were just plain horrible, there just are no other words to describe it.  The beans and rice needed a good dousing of salt, and the enchiladas were plain and boring.  After asking for about every hot sauce in their restaurant (btw they do not have any good hot sauce) the manager ended up giving me a house-made smoked sauce.  That actually tasted pretty damn good on the enchiladas, and I think they should actually use this rather than what they have on their menu.  I was pretty disappointed overall because of the entree choice.  I don't need things to be spicy, I need them to be flavorful.  They are missing the mark on this, and it's sad!

I'll visit again hopefully soon and maybe then I'll take it up to 4 stars.  \n\nStarting off the cocktails were the best part of the meal, the Tres Verde was fantastic and I would recommend it highly.  The appetizer we choose was the elotes since my wife wasn't eating meat.  Corn isn't in season so I'll give them a bit of a pass, but it wasn't great.  Fairly forgettable.  I got the chicken enchiladas for dinner.  The sauce on the enchiladas was pretty good and I was happy with the dish overall.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  My wife continuing with the no meat theme, got the Tacos de Camote, which she enjoyed very much.  Finished up with the Tres Leches and again it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  \n\nThe feel of Verde I enjoyed very much.  The decor and openness I thought was a real plus.

{"text": "Inconsistent, at best, but I am so rooting for it to get better.\n\nI've been there twice in the last week and had one excellent dish (which was mediocre the next night), two okay dishes, an oddly plated dish, and an inedible dish.  Likewise for the drinks: two excellent cocktails, and one we had to send back.\n\nAtmosphere: The space is great - large with adequate space between tables, mood lighting but not so dark we couldn't see our food, and on a week night it was quiet enough to hear each other talk (weekend evening was loud).  The floor-to-ceiling windows contribute to the sense of spaciousness and the mixture of booth, table and bar seating contributes to the liveliness.\n\nDrinks: On the weekday night we started at the bar where we had the full attention of the bartender, who was passionate about what he was doing and happy to share his craft (ok, to be truthful, it took a little time to get him to treat us as knowledgeable drinkers, but once he did, he turned around and starting sharing the finer points of what they were trying to do with the drink offerings, which was a pleasure).  The Sopa de Fuego cocktail was out of this world - spicy, sour, sweet, bitter - fabulous combination, and we kept them coming. The tequila Manhattan was also excellent - not too sweet, and with a lovely roundness. The top shelf Margarita had to be sent back because it was weak.\n\nFood: The good news is that the servers aim to please - they were willing to switch out salsas, discuss the food with interest and knowledge, and make changes to dishes to avoid allergies and special requests. Also good news were the crisp chips and tomatillo salsa brought to the table when we arrived. And some of our dishes were quite good; the Fritos De Camarones y Maiz were tasty with the delicate flavor of the rock shrimp shining through (the middle was a bit undercooked, but not too doughy). The caesar salad was also good, although somewhat odd in presentation: an *entire* head of romaine had simply been sliced in half lengthwise and laid on the plate with a couple of spoonfulls of dressing. Good, but too much lettuce and not enough dressing. On the other hand, the guacamole was a problem. We ordered a side of guacamole but requested that the kitchen leave out one ingredient and what came out was . . . avocados mashed in big chunks (perhaps a small splash of lime). No anything else!  And the avocado was tasteless. On the first night the Pozole Verde was outstanding - chunks of melt-in-the-mouth pork in a rich pork broth with a a couple of spoonfuls of pozole and traditional garnishes of cabbage, radishes and some pumpkin seeds.  The flavor was excellent and there was a creamy texture to the soup that was glorious.  I could have happily eaten a second bowl!  On the second night, however, the Pozole was inedible - 1/4 inch of fat floated on the top of the soup, and the creamy texture had been replaced with the mouthfeel of cornstarch thickener.  Worst of all, there was a taste like liquid smoke to the soup that didn't fit at all - it tasted artificial. Speaking of liquid smoke, that was the taste that dominated the Enchiladas de Verduras - it didn't taste like it came from a smoker, but from a bottle. Despite some nice red rice on the side, the dish was inedible and, after one bite each, we pushed it aside. \n\nSome serious kinks in consistency to be worked out, and some refinements to be made to the dishes before the food comes to match the decor. I'm rooting for them - a fabulous tequila list, prime location, and good space means that this place good be a big win if they push for consistency and quality in the food.", "user_id": "33k6MEYCapCsDSkE3xlklg", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 2}

Stop judging me, sidebar!\n\nThis is my second visit to Verde, the first being during their \"soft\" opening.  I decided not to review it at that time - instead giving the place a little more time to get their cajones together.  No such luck on this visit.  During my first visit I was treated to the very warm atmosphere and friendliness of the bartending staff. Unfortunately, my trio of friends waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and things didn't improve from there.  The food was fine, but pricey for what we got IMO.  Round Corner Cantina does it better and cheaper...again, IMO.  \n\nThis second visit was more of the same. Again we waited for our drinks, which this time were just a pair of Diet Cokes and a water, so no complicated mortar and pestle business there.  My two buds ordered the same dinner - grilled chicken tacos and I had the Pollo En Mole Poblano or, Big Ass Piece of Chicken, for short.  Again, the food was totally fine.  Their tacos were fine tacos and my chicken was fine chicken, though pretty bland.  The best and most surprising part of the menu was the Mango Iced Tea, which we only discovered due to an unexpected shortage of Diet Coke (true story).  \n\nI want to like Verde.  Mexican is my absolute favorite genre next to cake and donuts.  Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen.  It's Round Corner, Mad Mex or Emiliano's for me.

Only there are open tables galore and you stand there staring at an incompetent host AND hostess.  We went twice.  Once without reservations, once with them.  Both times we waited.  Both times there were at least 10 open tables.  Both times the host and hostess were about as friendly as a dead person.  Trust your gut instinct in turning around and leaving if the front of the house is any indication on what is about to come your way.\n\nWe ordered alcohol and probably would have enjoyed ourselves more had we been afforded the opportunity to get drunk.  But unfortunately our server was too busy to ask us if we wanted more drinks.  Can you imagine?  A place that has a bigger alcohol menu than food menu NOT asking you for more drinks is like going to Pizza Hut and them asking you if you want a salad.  In fact, we never saw the waiter after placing our order again until our food was delivered.  It's fine considering he had no personality.  A tall skinny guy.  A short haired pierced lip woman delivered our food and was WAY more friendly than he ever was. \n\nWe ordered the tableside Guacamole that mentions choosing your own ingredients.  We ask the waiter about it, after being made to feel stupid for asking, our guac is delivered already prepared.  I think they do this because they don't want you to see the amount of salt they pour into this.  I now know what it feels like to lick a salt block. At least they didn't mess up the red rice we ordered.   On the ONE positive of the visit, the \"generous\" free chips and salsa (rolling my eyes) they provide were quite tasty.  \n\nI will likely never give this place another chance.

Give me El Campesino, Mexico City or Patrons any day of the week over this for tasty, traditional Mexican.  \n\nThe restaurant has a modern feel and has a great outside patio.  Luckily, because we went at 8:45 we didn't have a wait.  I tried the red Sangria which was excellent and then we tried the Infusions tequila flight.  They have an amazing selection of tequila so even though tequila and I are not good friends, I gave it a shot.  My favorite was the Agave Loco which was infused with jalapeno peppers.  Surprisingly good and you know it's good when even a tequila hater likes it.\n\nThe green tomatillo salsa they brought out was also very tasty and had just the right amount of spice.  For our late dinner, we split an black bean and corn empanadas appetizer and the chicken enchilada dinner which was served with beans and rice.  The empanadas were excellent and they gave you two huge empanadas.  Even though we split the appetizer, between the one empanada and the salsa and chips, i was stuffed.  Then, out came the chicken enchiladas which had waaaaaaaay too much salt in them.  Other than that, they would have been quite tasty but the salt was just too much.  The flavors were bold, the vegetables were fresh and the service was attentive.  \n\nSo I guess the big question is with all the positives, why only 3 stars?

The first thing that struck us when we walked in was the noise level. It's loud in there. We were seated at a table near the bar where a gaggle of girls seemed to be having a heated conversation/borderline fight.

Although this probably would have annoyed the average diner, especially because several waiters passed by and did not say anything to them.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table, which came out promptly. The first, a deep dried artichoke with aioli, was dry and tasteless. The batter had a bitterness to it that I can't quite explain? And the aioli was oily and thick- no flavor. The flatbread was decent- tasty mushrooms but the sauce, like a black bean mole, was cold and dry as well. OK, two disappointments so far. Will the ceviche pull through???!!! Why....yes! This was def the highlight of the meal- LOVED it!!!! It was probably the best I've ever had! Nice, big chunks of tender, perfectly marinated fish. I could have scooped the entire thing into my mouth at once. SO good!\n\nThe main entrees did not come out as quickly.

Since our first encounter, I have taken my own advice several times and come here, treating it as a bar more than a restaurant, reveling in a variety of tequilas, and cocktails involving it. They bring around your first round of chips for free if you're at a table, and they're unlimited at the bar. Along with the chips, their appetizers are usually enough to split between two people over drinks, but they usually have a few items on special so you might want to enjoy a flatbread made with the freshest ingredients they could find that day.\n\nBeing one who enjoys to branch out as much as I can, I love to come in for their Agave Wednesdays, that is: a half-oz 'taste' of any tequila on their wall(that is usually priced under $18) for only $3! So, you can create your own flights of tequila to suit your tastes, or let the bartender know what you like and have them spin up their own. Be sure to ask for the iPad menu to get an interactive look at their selection, along with tasting notes and label texts. \n\nTheir patio recently opened, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Service has also been greatly improved since the last view - now very attentive and friendly, if not still a bit scripted. The bartenders are all wonderful, very well versed in all of the tequilas and in making excellent cocktails.\n\nIf you're looking to grab a few drinks or get an education in tequila, and get some excellent modern mexican-inspired snacks(And maybe dinner, but I haven't tried in a while), Verde is probably the best place to stop.

Being a huge fan of the food at Verde in general (especially the Guacamole, Tacos de Camote, and Tres Leches), I was super excited when I heard they were introducing a brunch menu on the weekends. \n\nIn general, the food is a unique twist on traditional Mexican food, always surprising me with an unusual and unexpectedly pleasant combination of flavors that I would never have dreamt up on my own. The brunch menu is consistent with this theme, making it tough to narrow down the choices. In the end, I ordered the Camote Hash (sweet potato hash) and Chilaquiles (almost like a breakfast version of nachos). I was not sure I would like the Chilaquiles when I ordered it - (tortilla chips and a sunny side up egg together in one dish?) but again, I was right to trust the chefs at Verde to fuse these ingredients with an amazing poblano crema sauce into a delightful and extremely satisfying meal. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. Fresh squeezed juice is hard to find in Pittsburgh, and it is definitely worth the price (so much so that I ordered a second glass). I did not try the Brunch Bottles, but they sound perfect for a group brunch, or just a couple planning for a lazy afternoon.", "user_id": "ulik60Aw4MMl3fKi78B_fg", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 5}

On the food end, I enjoyed the guacamole and potato and chorizo tacos (the latter are not currently on the menu).  \n\nMy trips for sit-down dinners have been less successful, primarily because of the speed of service and some just okay main courses.  The servers are all quite friendly, but can be difficult to find and service, especially with drinks, can be very slow.  I am all for a leisurely-paced meal, but it is often inconsistently slow (e.g., very long wait for order, including drinks, to be taken; long wait for drinks; long wait for apps; entrees come out immediately after apps).  The tacos are generally quite good and the portion sizes just right.  I have had less success with the other mains.  I have tried the steak, the fish of the day twice, and the vegetable as well as the chicken enchiladas.  All were cooked well, but the flavors just didn't come together for me.  \n\nI'll definitely go back to the bar many times and enjoy some appetizers, but the service will have to be more consistent for me to become a regular table diner.", "user_id": "zVDw7gbwQrQFJTv5VJNEWw", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "This is a compromise review rating. In terms of food (at this price point), this is a 2-star restaurant. In terms of cocktails and atmosphere, this is a 4-star restaurant. \nI really hope they kick up their food a notch and earn a 4-star rating because I really want to love this restaurant. \n\nSo onto the details. I went for brunch this Sunday after drooling over the well-written brunch menu. However, I was sorely disappointed with the food. I ordered the french toast which was dry and way too bready, with barely a smear of bland jalapeno cream cheese and served with a cup of generic maple syrup (i.e. Aunt Jemima). I accept and understand artificial maple syrup at a mediocre diner, but not at a place intending to have good food. My husband's eggs benedict was definitely more successful, but the \"guajillo hollandaise\" might as well have been made with red bell peppers it was so mild and sweet. Maybe the chef is pulling punches because there have been complaints about spice in other reviews but when you order something with guajillo, you have to expect some spice.\n\nNow that I've whined about my mediocre food experience, I will give credit where it is due. The brunch cocktails are inventive and delicious. They use a clearly home-made (and very spicy) bloody mary mix. They use fresh citrus in the margaritas. They shake the cocktails well. I look forward to returning for one of their well-advertised happy hours and enjoying more of their cocktails or perhaps a tequila flight from their extensive selection while sitting at their gorgeous modern bar. After a few of those drinks, I might even learn to appreciate the food. \n\nIn spite of their short-comings, Verde clearly has a good following - with most of the tables indoors and out filling up for brunch by 11:30 on Sunday. This is a happening spot and has a lot of potential. Let's hope I have the chance to update my review soon.", "user_id": "Iseb_IvqOEfY_p1m9OwTrw", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Every person who drinks has a tequila tale that is as unfortunate as a Faulkner novel.  Whether you unwisely entered into a shot contest, or tried to power down a third Big Azz margarita at Mad Mex, they all have a pretty familiar ending.  Pittsburgh has been a beer-centric town for as long as I can remember, and a plastic bottle of tequila sitting on a table at a party was a terrible omen.\n\nEnter Verde.\n\nVerde is a high end Mezcal and Tequila bar, which seems like a hard sell in a town where 65% of the drinking population thinks that a team jersey counts for formal wear, and jean shorts are never completely out of the question.  \n\nI had really only planned to have beer when we first came here.\n\nBut those beautiful bottles on the wall.  Oh so many shapes and colors.  They beckoned like shiny little Sirens of excess.  Asking the bartender about her preferred drink triggered an enlightening and fun conversation that was more informative than any conversation I've had at a bar.  My friend had lived in Arizona for several years before returning to Pittsburgh, and he, along with the bar manager persuaded me to try a specially selected Mezcal flight.  And what happened next was unlike anything I have ever experienced on a night where Tequila was involved.  Mainly, my pants remained on, but also, I found that tequila doesn't have to be a wincing, gag inducing test of manhood.  \n\nThe flight consists of a little board with 4 samples of various tequilas, with a little tomato juice to cleanse the palate.  They apparently have a variety of nights where you can learn about the various tequila and mezcal options, and try them at discounted rates.  \n\nOk, wrapping it up.  This place is very nice and all, but the bartenders are the anchor that will keep this place going.  It's a beautiful space that has been increasingly crowded every time I've been.  I'm excited to see how it evolves over the next year.  Will it blossom into it's own Agave plant, or will it become another Senor Frogs?

{"text": "In sum, delicious and innovative brunch.\n\nMy instincts told me to overlook my interesting dinner experience from months ago and to give the brunch a whirl. Boy ol' boy am I glad I did. \n\nI did not make it easy on Verde either. I chose the huevos benedictos. The first properly cooked egg I learned to make back when I was a wee munchkin was poached eggs. Why poached? I LOVED eggs benedict. I've eaten this breakfast brunch staple since I could write in cursive. Hence, it is difficult to impress me with this dish. Verde's interpretation provided me new insight into traditional comfort breakfast.\n\nWow, wow wow! I cannot say enough wonderful things about this dish. Blue corn muffins were thicker than I would have thought and I enjoyed the sweet corn dimension. The house-cured bacon was smoky, sweet, caramelizing slabs of Nirvana. Next up, was the wild card for me: wilted escarole. Huh? When I read the description on the menu I would not let myself over think it- I wanted to try something different. Wow wow wow. This dish would not be the same without the slightly bitter and acidic wilted escarole. It provides another dimension of flavor that balances this dish. Why does traditional benedict lack this delicious component? The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with the yolk center seeping throughout the layers of deliciousness with only a soft nudge from a fork. \n\nLast and certainly not least- guajillo hollandaise. So few establishments can make a proper hollandaise. Let alone one that can balance acidity, smokiness, and heat. I loved this sauce. As the queen of sauces I can say I will spent endless hours in the kitchen attempting to recreate this masterpiece or perhaps I should just attend brunch here more often.  Either way, order this dish if you love Mexican cuisine and understand what a proper eggs benedict should be. This will allow one to appreciate the balance, depth and beautiful complexity this dish has to offer. \n\nMy ravings about this restaurant does not stop at the eggs. The coffee. I am a coffee snob- through and through. I also appreciate it brewed strong the way I believe all coffee should be made. Their coffee has a strong body and the beans have a rich dark roast. The hand squeezed orange juice was a tad pricey at 4$ glass. Nevertheless, the OJ was fresh and yummy.\n\nI tried a taste of my husband's has de carne ahumada. Another delightful dish [although I still think my dish was the best]. Cubed and sauteed sweet potatoes were a delicious spin on the typical potato hash. My husband even agreed and he is a white potato lover- through and through. Peppers and red onions were grilled and tasted nicely seasoned. The smoked brisket was balanced and cooked properly. Not dry, not overly seasoned but moist and possessed a mellow element of smoke. \n\nJared also ordered a side of chorizo. Let me tell you, my husband is a sausage fiend. His basic food groups are beef, potatoes, and sausage. He could not say enough wonderful things about the chorizo and remarked one can taste the freshness of the pork and felt the balance of spices and tone of cinnamon were delicious. \n\nThe only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was the speed of the service. We had a lovely waitress who was very nice. Yet, we waited quite a bit to be greeted and even longer for our coffee. In the morning, I NEED my caffeine...quickly. Other than the slow service [which was something we also experienced during our dinner a few months back] breakfast was excellent =)", "user_id": "MLZ9xHl8odrUaDbi1fzbAQ", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Food: Verde offers slightly higher end Mexican food with most of the expected staples of the Mexican or Mex-American cuisine.  This isn't a place where you simply choose a burrito, taco, enchilada, fajita, etc. with the usual toppings.  Instead of 5 different takes on each of those previously mentioned items, Verde has less than 10 total entrees to choose from, but each are well thought out and original.  Tacos, enchiladas, stuffed peppers, and more are filled with creative, local ingredients not found at your typical Mexican eatery.  We had the Ensalada Verde, which was far from the usual house salad and included beets, chayote, and a great cactus cilantro vinaigrette that was one of the best dressings I've had in a while.  The guacamole tastes fresh (although they don't make it in front of you) and has some spice.  The enchiladas had a legit smoky taste and tasty ingredients like roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, and caramelized onions.  For dessert we tried the Tres Leches, which was okay, and the house made Mango sorbet, which was excellent and super refreshing on a hot summer night.  Verde has a gluten-free menu, many items either are or can be made vegetarian, and several items can be made vegan.  Chips and salsa are on the house, and the house green salsa (salsa verde) is a nice change from the typical red salsa at most Mexican restaurants.  Everything we ordered was at least average, and in most cases was tasty and different.\n\nPrice: Verde is a little pricier than the typical Mexican restaurant, but the unique and high quality ingredients somewhat justify the cost.  Entrees range from $12-22, and the portions are large enough to fill you.  After some complimentary chips, an appetizer or two, and an entree, you won't have room for anything but tequila.\n\nDrinks: Although Verde seems more of a restaurant with a bar than a bar with a restaurant, their drink selection is pretty impressive.  The quantity and quality of tequila is flat-out intimidating.  They have many beers and some special cocktails to choose from, but we stuck to margaritas.  The El Jardin margarita, which contained strawberries and local rhubarb, was good, but the Blackberry Basil margarita was phenomenal.  Served in a martini glass, these are high class margaritas that are poured stiff but go down easy.  We also tried the house margarita, on the rocks, which was very well made.  The drinks aren't cheap, but they are effective.\n\nAtmosphere: Verde offers a full-service bar with seating for dinner, a relatively large dining room, and plenty of outdoor seating.  We went on a Monday night and it was busy, so its probably a good idea to make a reservation on the weekend or be prepared to wait (and drink).  The atmosphere is trendy but comfortable with big screen TVs at the bar and warming lamps outside.  Tables can accommodate 2 or very large parties.\n\nService: We sat at the bar while waiting for our table.  Our bartender was very friendly, asked us if it was our first time at Verde and gave us a rundown of what to expect.  He went into some detail about the cocktails and tequila choices, and it seemed like he could have talked a lot more if we had asked.  He made awesome drinks and was very quick and attentive.  The waitstaff at our table was also good.  They seemed a little understaffed as our waiter had quite a few tables to take care of, but he held his own.  The service wasn't anything to remember, which can be taken either way.  We weren't amazed, but we weren't at all bothered.\n\n(+): awesome margaritas, absurd tequila list, more upscale take on Mexican cuisine, good place for a date or to get started before heading to the bar\n\n(-): could potentially be a little expensive\n\nWould I go back again?

{"text": "Not only was the service terrible, the food was utterly disappointing. When we entered the restaurant the hostess said no greeting and was rather stand-offish. For a restaurant that has over 100 tequilas it was disheartening when my mother's margarita arrived tasting like salty water. After looking over the limited menu, our waiter recited the specials while mispronouncing half of them and stumbling over the list. Our salads arrived on beautiful plates, but to our surprise, half, if not more of the leaves were brown and wilting. Hoping for more in our entrees, they arrived and were subpar at best. The tamales were extremely small portions for 18 dollars and drenched in barbecue sauce. My tacos were in cheap, flour tortillas you can buy a bag of for 3 dollars at Giant Eagle. After finishing our dinner, we sat with our half eaten plates in front of us for at least 20 minutes while our waiter walked by numerous times not once asking how everything was or if he could clear away our obviously finished plates. We dined outside which was a very nice setting, and when we looked inside we saw another table that had their dirty plates sitting in front of them for an extremely long time. Finally, once our waiter cleared away our plates, he brought the check placing it not in the center of our table, but directly to my father, and did not say one word. No thank you, have a good evening, etc. and to top it off stood behind my father waiting as my father looked in his wallet. Once my father placed his credit card with the bill, our waiter immediately took the bill, and again did not say anything. I could not imagine anything rudder our waiter could have done.\nThe best part of this restaurant is looking at it.

{"text": "Meh.  Spoiler alert:  I won't go back.  It wasn't \"bad,\" but it certainly wasn't \"good.\"  \n\nI arrived to find the restaurant half full (at least 10 open tables inside) and was promptly informed by the hostess that we'd have \"at least a one-and-a-half to two hour wait\" if we wanted to sit inside.  \"Lots of reservations!\"  Umm yeah, when we left an hour later...tables were still open.   By no means crowded.\n\nImmediate seating outside, ok whatever.  The service was a bit slow but I remained optimistic.  I was a little skeptical of the menu and specials -- wild rice in chile rellenos?  The fish of the day....walleye?  What is this, Minnesota?\n\nWe went with the carnitas tamales and fish tacos.\n\nGeneral review of the food:\n**Margaritas - VERY good, and strong!  Two thumbs up.\n**Chips and salsa - Salsa was WAY too sweet.\n**Tamales & Carnitas - Odd.  Covered in BBQ sauce; rather than using masa they appear to have used sweet potato (???) and it ended up dry and WAY too sweet.\n**Spanish rice & beans - kind of gross.\n\nAll in all, it was edible.

{"text": "Okay.  I have to preface the review with a comment.  All you \"Yelpers\" who slam Verde for not being \"authentic\"...get your heads out of your a$$e$!  Verde doesn't intend to be authentic Mexican, it says \"MODERN Mexican!\"  You want Taco Bell?  Go to Taco Bell and stay the hell out of one of the BEST restaurants in Pittsburgh...Mexican or otherwise. Thank you.  Rant ended.\n\nCheff LBee puts out some of the most creative cuisine in the 'Burgh.   (Big plus...they have a gluten-free menu!)   I LOVED the twist I had recently on a tamale - succulent BBQ pulled pork.  No, it wasn't a traditional tamale and I'm grateful for that...it was HUGE.  The size alone was untraditional.  Sweet, spicy, tender pork encased in a masa crust was everything I could want in great food with a Mexican/Southern twist.  \n\nAnother visit for brunch with the fam.  Once again it wasn't a \"traditional\" Mexican menu.  Thank God.  If it had been traditional, I don't think I would have been offered the amazing sweet potato/smoked brisket with a 5-minutes egg perched atop.  Wow.  The potatoes were crisp, yet smooth on the inside, the brisket was smoky and played nicely with the sweet potatoes, the 5-minute egg oozed its golden yolk across the hash to make a lovely sauce.  Truth be told here, my plate came out and before I could cut into the egg, another egg came out.  The waiter explained the kitchen realized the original egg had cooked too long and wanted to be sure I had the proper egg for the dish.  Love that!  How many places would have just let it go?  Not LBee!\n\nThen there are the cocktails.  One of the best cocktail programs in the city reside right there at Verde.  I had the opportunity to chat for a good while with Allie, one of Verde's expert mixologists.  Even better than talking mixology (one of my fave subjects!), was the cocktails!  My favorite of all was the La Fortunada...I don't remember what all was in it, but gin.  Yeah, not tequila, who knew a Mexican restaurant that specializes in tequila did GIN so well!  The Copa del Fuego margarita with jalapeno and cardamom satisfied my heat and warm spice cravings...and their Paloma (had this at brunch) with grapefruit, lime and resposado tequila made a perfect accompaniment to brunch.  Oh hell...it would be perfect anytime!\n\nIf you're looking for \"typical\" Mexican, don't bother to darken the doors of Verde.  If you're looking for creative, exceptional cuisine and cocktails in a casual and friendly atmosphere, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!

{"text": "Verde kind of fell off the radar for me, even after a couple great meals there, just because I don't crave Mexican often (and if I do--you can probably just find me at Chipotle. Sorry not sorry). But my friend and I wanted to try a new place for brunch after way too many visits to Meat & Potatoes and we realized we hadn't tried Verde's brunch yet!\n\nBrunch reminded me how much I really like Verde! In fact, I think I like their brunch even better than their dinner! I like hashes because they often involve slow-cooked meat and poached eggs. But since I'm not a big potato fan, I find myself digging through a sea of potatoes for scraps of meat like some crazy brunch archeologist. However! I AM a sweet potato fan, so Verde's sweet potato-brisket hash was the perfect solution to my problem! The 5-minute eggs were nice for something a little different, although one of mine was just slightly overcooked. I saw some orders of the eggs benedict float by our table that were totally droolworthy.\n\nMy only thing about brunch is that I don't like how they don't have appetizers. I usually order an appetizer with brunch, and I don't think I'm alone, so this is kind of a missed opportunity.\n\nFor dinner I've always gotten the carne asada or the carne asada tacos when they have them and haven't been dissappointed.\n\nThe service here is friendly and laid-back, but honestly, a little TOO laid-back. It's always pretty slow. The bartenders, though, are great. And every drink I've had has been really tasty AND really strong.

{"text": "I really wanted to like this place. And it was not good at all. \n\nWe stopped in on a Thursday night around 8:30. Salt of the Earth was too crowded, so we walked up the street to Verde. Since we anted to go here for a while but kept forgetting about it, we thought it kinda worked out that we could go there instead. \n\nThe place was about 30% full. Most people were sitting outside and I think my 30% is pretty generous. We sat inside. Our waiter was very nice and welcoming. He read the specials. (there seemed to be more specials than food on the menu.) Also the descriptions of the food were so detailed that I really would have preferred if I could have read them myself. \n\nWe ordered two tequila flights. For $6 each, it seemed like a bargain. Nothing was explained about what we would receive. He seemed to have read off brand names of tequila, but they could have been the names of mixed drinks. Regardless, a $6 tequila flight seemed like a good deal. \n\nFor food we ordered the seviche special and the pork tacos ( also a special.) Someone promptly brought us water and chips and salsa. \n\nThe chips and salsa were the first things to come out. Things were clearly not going to be good.... The salsa was green, like a tomatillo base? Maybe, but it was sweet... Didn't taste like much else. \n\nWe waited a bit longer for our drinks and food. \n\nAnd a bit longer. \n\nThe we got a fresh order of fish tacos with black beans and rice on the side. They looked great. I was hungry and I ate some of the beans and picked some veggies off the tacos. \n\nThen I remembered that we didn't order fish tacos. Fish gets fishy when fried or overcooked. The fish smell was a little too much. We eventually found our waiter and told him that we thought we had ordered the spicy pork tacos. He was like, \"the pork tacos aren't spicy,\" and I was all \"ummm.... Ok, but we didn't order fish tacos regardless.\" \n\nHe took the tacos away. \n\nWe waited some more. And ate sweet weird salsa. \n\nThen the ceviche came. The fish, which type I can't  recall now, was thick and fleshy and white. it should have been cut into smaller pieces. It was lemony and Limey. It needed salt and some other flavoring. It also didn't taste like fresh lemon or lime, but rather the bottled kind. \n\nThe our tequila came. Either they were tiny mixed drinks with tequila or different kinds of tequila. One had tomato juice in it. They came with a paper label, but it didn't help. It told you about favors you might taste. Some tasted like straight warm tequila, while others tasted like mixed drinks. They were ok, but I still don't know what they are. I never saw the waiter again to ask. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later our pork tacos came. They were not good, the tortilla was good, as we're the pickled veggies on it. But the pork was big fat dry pieces that had been boiled. They were not tender. They should have been shredded with a lime squeezed on them. Big hard chunks of pork are not easy to eat in a soft taco shell. (The tacos came as a pair. They were large and served with a side of rice and beans. Also they were cheap... Like $10)\n\nUgh. Nothing was expensive (about $10 for entrees), but nothing was good enough to come back. Maybe the tequila?", "user_id": "L6y73vaWaSvqYUKq6Rsr2w", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 2}

{"text": "This was my first trip to Verde and I  normally do not write a review unless I have experienced a restaurant at least twice, but I wanted to chime in here to counter some of the negative reviews as well as to provide some perspective here.  Full disclosure, I worked in Tucson AZ for almost two years and have traveled extensively through Mexico.  So, with that...\n\nI think the food is very good Mexican food for anywhere, nearly stunning by Pittsburgh standards.    I was there with a group and we did an entire group tasting menu, complete with the house margaritas which where tasty and not too potent for a Sunday night.   \n\nThe tomatillo salsa was good, with nice spicing and depth of flavor. I could have used a bit more heat but in all very well done.  We ordered some guacamole that was good, not great.  I generally like a bit more heat and flavor but clearly it was better than most I have had locally.\n\nThe vegetarian empanadas were a favorite of the table, light and tasty with a great pepito sauce that gave them the right zing.   The crust was light and fluffy, reminiscent of puff pastry dough.\n\nThe seviche special was swordfish and I expected tough and fishy, and got just the opposite.  Light and tasty with a great citrus and spice flavor that worked well with the simply prepared but yummy fried plantains.   \n\nThe pulled port tamale was quite good, probably the best I have had in the Pittsburgh area.  I would generously compare it to those I have had in TX and AZ, with great texture and flavor throughout with just enough kick for balance.  \n\nWe moved to the smoked chicken enchiladas which were very tasty, and while they were a bit heavily sauced, still quite authentic and well balanced.   I would give them a good not great if not for the really awesome smokey flavor of the chicken, that really made the dish.  \n\nThe carne asada was good, again not great but a great option for the \"less than adventurous\" in the group.  Note that it was very well prepared, we ordered medium rare and it was perfect.  \n\nLast but certainly not least were the fish tacos, specifically mahi mahi.  They were a joy and definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  The mahi was well spiced and full of flavor.  Served in classic San Diego style with cabbage and sauce, I found them to be a favorite of the meal.\n\nIn all, the place is well done and I recommend it as both a place for a nice meal with friends as well as a dinner with the family.  I thought that the only drawback was the ambiance, as it was a bit too trendy and open which could work against it during a crowded night.  It was quiet the night we were there but I could see on a busy night it could be a bit on the loud side.   \n\nI highly recommend Verde!", "user_id": "JBC6Sg_gWlQFjKwmC5PlDQ", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 4}

The food was excellent, we had the chicken tacos and smoked chicken enchillada.  Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful and assisted us in designing our own Tequila flights to sample from their extensive tequila menu.  Our server even recommended a new tequila that wasn't even on the menu yet, which was also excellent.  Our only complaint was the lack of parking, which admittedly goes with the territory in this part of the city.  There are just a few spots behind the building (which were all taken), so we were stuck with street parking, and the surrounding streets are not well signed, so we couldn't tell if we were illegally parked or not.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the type of restaurant- not cheap, but not overpriced either with reasonable portions.  Tequila prices were comparable to other places in the city, and the chance to customize a tequila flight is a great way to sample lots of different options without spending a fortune.

They also had the big back table all ready for us. I got a Caipirinha and she ordered the Forbidden root margarita. Both bartenders were nice and offered us chips and salsa. After the second offer we figured sure why not and were pleased to see a tangy tomatillo salsa that went with the chips. Once some of our party got there we closed our tab and went and sat down. More chips, more yummy salsa and another Caipirinha later we were deciding what we wanted. I believe our servers name was Joe, and he did a great job working with our large party. He made sure the drinks were full and talked to the group in half so he didn't have to keep screaming for everyone to hear him. Some of the specials sounded great that night, I wish that they printed a daily specials menu because there were so many specials I lost track of what was what as he was saying them.

After all, we want to see if it's really worth coming back, but when you look at the cost vs. flavor that Verde is serving up, it's just not worth it...and we're the furthest people from frugal. Only two restaurants in recent memory have made me actually look at the check and feel like I just wasted money. Verde, unfortunately, was one of those places.\n\nFor apps we tried the fritos de camarones y maizi. They were good, but after a few bites, became very monotonous and greasy. I found myself digging deeper in the shallow puddle of crema to add flavor. We didn't even finish the plate. I then moved on to the patatas bravas. These were okay, but the potatoes were just drenched in sauce that, again, became very bland after a few bites.\n\nFor our meals, I got the fish tacos. They were good. Light and flavorful. My wife got the pork tacos, which were the special that night. Those, too, were really good. For my drink, I opted to try the veranda, and I'd recommend that to anyone...even though the bartender told me that he messed up and used Wigle rye instead of regular Wigle, it was excellent!\n\nAfter a blah start to our meal, I ended up being happy with our main plates. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away enough for the cost. Don't get me wrong, the prices aren't that bad, but if I'm paying essentially $8/taco, I'm going to Yo Rita for more adventurous, filling, and impressive tacos. Is that subjective? Absolutely, but it's an opinion I'll stand behind. Verde might have the East End popularity to support it, and it's a good restaurant, but it's far from worthy of the hype.\n\nWould I go back?

{"text": "A disappointment!  For me, it's not even about the argument for \"authentic\" Mexican food or whatever:  this restaurant offers poor service, a number of cold and oily dishes at an unreasonable price, and watery drinks (a waste if the restaurant is framed around this fancy tequila library they're so proud of).\n\nI was in a medium-sized party seeking to get some drinks; we were a maybe on food, none of us had planned to eat full meals.  When we asked for a table, we were told that tables had to be saved for customers eating dinner.  OK -- totally fair when you're slammed with reservations and have a line out the door -- but this was a SUNDAY evening before the dinner rush, and the place wasn't even half full.  We really had to insist before the manager(?) signaled to the hostess that we could be seated.\n\nSo we get to looking at the menus and things look interesting, despite the high prices; we end up ordering food after all.  I decide on the special tacos -- gross!  Another commenter mentioned pork tacos filled with big chunks of awful overcooked rubberized things -- that was exactly what I was served.  These chewy pork nuggets were piled on top of what I was told were going to be \"crispy\" taco shells -- in actuality, oil-soaked corn tortillas -- and topped with some weird applesauce-like chutney that was so sickly-sweet I couldn't bear it.  On top of all of that, my dish was barely warm.  No wait, on top of all that, my dish was $14!  You can get good, juicy, spicy, hot pork tacos in town for three bucks.\n\nPaired with a measly 5-oz cocktail that cost $10 and had a giant thumb-shaped lemon zest garnish in it?  A total scam.  If a cocktail costs $10, you invest a little time in the garnishes, the temperature of the glass, other little details.\n\nAll the mentions of slow service in other reviews are true.  Like another commenter, we sat around with our plates all sad and dirty for 20 minutes before our table was cleared.\n\nJust gross.

Then once our meals came, my boyfriend took 1 cut into his chicken & there was literally A POOL OF BLOOD in it!  Not even just pink, but lots of blood. I have no idea what took them so long to get us our food, considering they barely cooked the meat. They gave him the option of having a new plate cooked for him or to order something else different from the menu & he opted for a vegetarian dish. He got this dish quicker, but i had already finished my meal by the time they were able to get it to him. \n\nI thought for sure we wouldn't be charged for his meal, but nope! They took a lousy $4 off our $60 bill. Talk about poor restaurant management! I've worked in restaurants before, and almost always the customer would have gotten their meal for free in this situation.\n\nThe prices were high compared to the food portions too.

There is outdoor seating with a garage style door leading outside and letting the breeze blow inwards. If I was rating Verde on decor and ambience alone, this would be a 5 star review.\n\nVerde boasts that they have the largest tequila selection in all of Pennsylvania. I have no idea if that's true or not, but I can tell you the tequila menu is beyond extensive. They have creative and yummy cocktails and the bartenders are quite skilled.  The house margaritas are among the best I've tasted. On my last visit to Verde I discovered the Black Rose craft cocktail, which contains blanco, Red Star Kombucha, blackberry, lime and a sprig of rosemary. I'm not a big drinker, but this is one incredible drink. A must try, I dare say. If I was rating Verde on drinks alone, this would be a 4.5-5 star review.\n\nBut a girl's gotta eat. I was excited to try some of the vegetarian offerings listed on The Verde menu. My first visit both my wife and I got the Yukon Gold potato tacos, and I remember liking them. Not the best I've ever had, but what they lacked was mostly made up for by the side of spicy rice and beans. Plus they come upright in a really fun taco type holder, which I've never seen elsewhere (and I looooove tacos). This past visit to Verde we were excited to branch out and try different vegetarian dishes, as we had looked online before heading out to see the menu had changed slightly. The potato tacos were no longer offered, now instead there were tempeh tacos in that slot. Sounded good, with veggies and a tomatillo salsa. Count me in. There are only two other vegetarian entrees to choose from currently, and when given the choice between enchiladas and tacos, tacos always win. Well, these weren't great. Adjectives that come to mind are \"edible\", \"bland\" and \"boring\". I was hoping for so much more! We decided that even though the tacos weren't winners that we would try dessert. We ordered the sopapillas, which sounded great in the description. What could be bad about fried dough with cinnamon sugar, guava infused honey and chocolate cherry ice cream? Well, again, they weren't bad, but even in my slightly tipsy state where everything should taste amazing, these didn't deliver. The dough was over fried, the ice cream had almost no detection of the chocolate and cherry favors I was promised. And for sharing for two people, I thought the portion size was small for the price and the underwhelming nature of what we got. \n\nYou go out to eat for a variety of reasons, but I always want to be wowed by the food, as well as the overall experience. I'm not wowed by the food at Verde. Sure, I like the ambience, the cocktails, and in my experience the service has been ok. But will any of these things make me rush back to Verde for the food?

{"text": "Very meh. So let me lead with my bias - I used to live in a heavily Mexican/Salvadorean part of Baltimore city (Highlandtown), and while there ate some of the best Mexican and Latin American food I've ever had. I have also traveled around Mexico, and have experienced both street food and Mexican fine dining. Verde failed at both. Their food lacks flavor, and is not at all true to the spirit of Mexican food. \n\nI went for lunch one day with a friend, and was sorely saddened by the showing. Their chips were okay, but the salsa was something I could have made much more flavorfully at home. They offered an appetizer with huitlacoche (a flavorful corn mushroom prized in Mexico that has a powerful aroma and strong mushroom flavor). The app did not have even the faintest flavor, whiff, or speck of this mushroom included to my taste. Everything on the menu was overpriced. The sauces reminded me of Boyardee more than the billed fiery tomato and tomatillo I had hoped for. The fillings were either bland or prepared without any understanding of Mexican flavors. Our tacos were acceptable, but I would compare the food quality more to Chili's than Mexican fine dining, which it seems Verde is trying for. \n\nThe mixed drinks we ordered were pretty good, but expensive, and not good enough to improve our overall poor impression.  I guess I expected more at this price range. Won't be returning, at least not for their dinner prices.\n\nIf you're looking for tasty Mexican or Latin American food, try anything from Los Palmas to Los Cabos to Reyna's for a better option.

I don't know what happened to the caramelized onion puree, but what stood prominent were the chewy potatoes with a very saturated smokey taste of chorizo. \n\nI'm such a fan of chicken wings and was really looking forward to these because I also love chimichurri.

Imagine that!\n\nMy wonderful experience faded somewhat after this point. Our server was very knowledgeable about the gluten free options on the menu (which are all clearly marked on the menu by the way!), but wasn't very attentive, in general, throughout our meal.

And of course its claim to fame is supposedly having a larger tequila selection than any other restaurant in PA, which is definitely the highlight here. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the different types of tequila (as they should be), and he helped us select 3 or 4 small shot samples to try. The quality of the tequila was incredible- ranging from smooth to smokey, some with incredible flavors- not at all what I had experience drinking before. The chips and salsa were incredible, and- most importantly to me (!)- the guacamole was delightful! I fully admit my subjectivity when reviewing Mexican or Tex Mex restaurants, because I tend to judge/rate them by the quality of the guac.

{"text": "This is the second time I've eaten here, and the quality of the service was pretty low both times. The first time, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was packed (it was after a first friday event), and our waiter was preoccupied with a really annoying picky woman at the table next to us who kept demanding things. He was, shall I say, innattentive. Whatever, the food was really good, and despite cold drafts from the door, we had a pretty good time (although we would have ordered more drinks if we could have gottent the waiters attention). This last time was on Valentines day. I made a reservation and specifically asked to have a table away from the door. The guy taking my reservation confirmed that request, but when we showed up, the hostess put us RIGHT BY THE DOOR, even though there were several open tables. So I had to ask her to move us to one of those, which she begrudgingly did. The server we had was equally inattentive, even though the place wasn't particularly busy (even though it was Valentines day). We lacked some silver ware, and though we asked him for some, he never brought it. I had to go steal some fro one of the empty tables. The food was still really great, though, but I don't think I'll be heading back here...", "user_id": "PwW3_AxAOGOk6Xn9AYru5g", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I was here after a Yelp event, so I was lucky to get a seat at the bar early and I didn't give it up until I left much later when the restaurant was getting packed.  I love the chips and pico, both are fresh and tasty.  The chips have that flaked sea salt that's just heaven when it melts on to a freshly-fried chip.  The pico de gallo is heavenly - zingy from fresh lime, mellow from tomatoes, a little spicy from onions, and tangy from cilantro.\n\nI also had a pollo taco on a soft flour tortilla.  The flavors were great and you can tell all of the ingredients walked in the door that morning.  I would have liked a bigger portion, though with each taco coming in at $5, you can tell you're supposed to try a few to make a meal out of it.\n\nThe bartenders were on their game when the event started, and while they were still friendly, it was hard to catch them after the event when the restaurant had filled.  I don't blame them at all, it would just have been nice to get a little acknowledgement as they passed that they'd be with me next/soon, though.\n\nI had a jalapena cocktail and it was the most expensive thing I ordered.  You're paying for quality; it was spicy and sweet and very delicious.  A fellow Yelper turned me on to this cocktail- it isn't on the menu yet, but it will be back on soon.  In the meantime, order it from Rachel, she said!\n\nPros: If you have an appreciation and love for tequila, this is your place.  I'm not at that point yet, and if it were closer to my house, I would probably get to that point quickly!  It is a little pricey, but it's quality.\nCons: price, small parking lot (though kudos for having one), spotty service when busy.", "user_id": "FKosz9ExVLhsrITQk5xl4g", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

We tried the double guac app which came with a little pork belly. The pork belly was great but one of the guacs was swapped in over salty queso cheese and honestly it was borderline gross. Way too much salt packed into a little punch not enough fresh garlic or lime or cilantro flavors in their guac. \n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas they were new American style meaning not baked they used corn tortillas (not a great choice if you love soft enchiladas. Their was some odd white sauce with the chicken which was nicely cooked, very tender. The rice was overly bland and beans were just ok. In short I doused the thing in Cholula and longed for my own mole pulled pork enchiladas. \n\nThe drinks: we had mojitos the first ones were good the second had way too much lime juice. I guess as the night wore on less care was taken. I could say the same for our waiter he was very attentive until after our appetizer came then we barely saw him. \n\nThe positives its a very nice space to eat in, we were able to be seated on a feb sat night within a half hour.

The tacos lack flavor and are far too expensive for food that's not nearly as good as I can make at home. I sent the steak tacos back once because they had nearly no flavor. Another time we ordered the guacamole and it was made with unripe avocados.

I came last night with a group of friends and immediately ordered a pitcher of margaritas coupled with the glorious chips and (particularly good) salsa, along with some tasty gaucamole. On top of this amazingness, I also tried the sopa blanca and tacos hongos. These were both perfectly flavored and seasoned, particularly the tacos. I don't think I've ever had mushroom tacos that good ever. The service was good, considering it was a very busy Saturday night, and I always enjoy the ambiance and people watching opportunities. The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating for me is that even for how good it is, I still consider the food to be significantly overpriced. First, 9 dollars for gacamole and chips? Really? This would cost about half as much at almost any other restaurant in the city. Also, my two small mushroom tacos ran 10 bucks, which is also about twice as much as two tacos at Cantina down the street.

{"text": "Last weekend I celebrated my 65th birthday by using one of my birthday presents. It turns out that this was one of three best birthday gifts ever! Number one was my grandson being born on my birthday two weeks earlier!! Number 2 is this gift, Number three was probably the rocking horse I got around three years old. So you can see that to be at the top of this list is pretty impressive. My sister, brother, sister-in-law, and nephews had bought me a Tequila and Maragrita lesson at Verde. We arrived on a beautiful, but cool, Saturday afternoon. In Verde's courtyard stood a small event tent. We were warmly greeted by the Jeff, Verde's owner, introduced to the two bartenders who would be helping teach the class, and kept warm by the tents heater. Soon 16 others joined us. On the table at each seat was a shot glass, a glass of water to cleanse our palates, a complete set of bar tools to eventually create our own Margarita, and the recipe that we would follow to be sure that our creation was drinkable.We were all asked to introduce ourselves by name and the reasons we wanted to get to know Tequila/Margarita better. My personal tradition for many years is to end the work week on Friday with one wife-made Margarita. It takes the edges of the days before, but I wondered if we could improve on an already good thing. Then the agave took the stage. We learned about the processing of the plant, the aging of tequila/mezcal, and soon began the tasting of three basic forms of Tequila. As we sipped our Tequila we were invited to describe the \"notes\" [flavors] that we tasted: peppery, bitey, minty, bourbon, etc. It turns out that my favorite of the Tequila is the Repasodo, not as bitey as the clear \"Blanco\" and not quite as full-flavored as Anjeo. The Reposado goes down more smoothly and without so much face-grimacing familiar to me with a shot of Blanco that I recalled from college days. After Tequila tasting we began to construct our Margaritas. We learned the measuring techniques, the importance of ice in a cocktail, how to shake and strain the mix before pouring the luscious concoction of Jimmy Buffet fame into the glass. It was the restaurant's own recipe for its basic Margarita, and it was delicious!! Our Friday nights at home will be enhanced with our new skill and the Verde recipe, and some Friday nights will be enjoyed at Verde where we will add Mexican and Spanish foods to accompany our Margaritas. I really loved this birthday gift, Jeff and his staff were great, and the sipping and 'rita topped off the celebration of my grandson Jackson's birth!", "user_id": "5lnsAGWmJPSE1niy_4TSFQ", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 5}
{"text": "I have heard a lot about Verde so when we were hungry after our event at the Pittsburgh Glass Center it was the perfect opportunity to finally try it out.\n\nWe only had the opportunity to try the lunch menu, so I may update the review if I make a return visit.  The lunch menu is extremely limited.    There were about five taco options and a burrito.  There were also limited appetizers and add ons.  \n\nThe reason my rating is three and not four stars was the service.  The place was almost empty and there were plenty of staff milling about.  They seated us but it took a while before they brought the menus.  Then it was quite a while before they came and took our order.  The manager even came over and asked if we had seen our waitress recently because we still had our menus.  Then the server came back twice.  The first time to ask us what we had ordered because they couldn't remember and the second time to tell me they were out of what I ordered.  It almost seemed like we were bothering them by our presence or were keeping them from a break.  \n\nWe started the meal with the chips and salsa.  We chose the spicy chipolte and it was fantastic.  They weren't kidding about the spice.  It was something that hit you a minute after you bit in, not right as you ate it.  It was nice that it had a bite but still had a lot of flavor.  \n\nBoth of us ordered a drink.  He tried the Casa Verde Margarita and I tried the El Jefe.  They were both tasty (and strong), but for the tiny glass we got the prices seemed a bit steep.  We both preferred the sweeter flavor of the El Jefe.\n\nI tried to order the Barbacoa and Hongos tacos, but they were out of both of them the day we visited.  Instead I opted for the Chorizo and camarones tacos on the corn tortillas.  My husband tried the burrito special.    The only thing I didn't like was the texture of the corn tortilla.  I've had corn tortillas before that had better taste and texture.  These were gritty and crumbly.  It didn't take away from the flavor of the contents, though.  I LOVED the chorizo taco.  It was the perfect amount of flavor.  I could have eaten several of them.  The Camarones had chipotle shrimp and lime mayo.  I ordered it without the pico since I'm not a huge tomato fan.  I also enjoyed this one and it was loaded with more shrimp then I expected.  My husband was content with the size and flavor of the burrito but was surprised to find there were several mushrooms in the burrito when there was no mention of mushrooms on the menu.  Be aware that the \"roasted vegetables\" may include mushrooms.  I would say it is an odd choice for a burrito, but I know Verde tends to do things differently.\n\nWe had contemplated dessert but in the interest of time and budget, we passed although the bread pudding sounded and looked great.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our food and left happy and satisfied.

Very fresh and relatively strong, which was a good thing because it was hot out and I had a looong day at work.\n\nWe ended up deciding to get some food; we all ordered tacos. On Tuesdays they are 20% off, so that certainly helped sway our decision. I ordered one chorizo and one barbacoa taco. The barbacoa was tender and very flavorful while mildly spicy. The chorizo, on the other hand, was quite spicy and also tasted great.

{"text": "I'm a Mexican food junkie. After saying about a billion times to my hubby, \"you know, we really should check out Verde\", we finally made it happen last Friday on the 4th of July. Yeah, we recognize the irony of celebrating the birth of America with some Pollo en Mole. Actually, is that irony?  I'm never sure if I use that word correctly. Maybe I should consult with Alanis Morrisette..\n\nAnyhow, so we scrounged up a few friends and headed over to Verde around 8pm on Friday. The place was pretty much deserted, since all of the other good patriots were downtown watching the fireworks. I loved the decor -- modern and hip with cultural flair (but not over-the-top loud like some other Mexican restaurants' decor tends to be).\n\nWe were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly waitress. I ordered the first of what turned out to be four (yes, four -- hey, it was America's b-day!) mojitos of the evening. Holy minty, smooth, sugary, rummy goodness Batman!  It was mojito perfection. I love the raw sugar cane stick they serve in it.  Probably one of the best mojitos I've ever had.\n\nThe food was equally as delicious. We started with some chips and salsa. I normally get grumpy when I have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant, but I have to say that at Verde, I didn't mind, because the hot chipotle salsa was amazing. Smoky, spicy, sweet, deeelicious. Totally worth the $3.\n\nThe yumminess continued with my chicken tacos. Super moist and flavorful. Yes, they were pricey at $5 bucks a pop (perhaps a bit overpriced), but I was at least 2 mojitos in by that point and didn't care :)  One of our friends got the aforementioned Polle en Mole, of which I stole several bites, and that was really flavorful as well. Overall, 5 stars for the food and drink!\n\nSo, 5 stars for the fare and libations, Tricia -- then why 4 stars overall? Well, dear Yelp reader, good question. As much as it pains me, I need to deduct a star for service. Our server wasn't inattentive or rude -- she came over many times to check on us and was quite friendly. The problem was that she was just  -- how can I say this nicely? -- she just needed to work on her \"remembering\" skills.  There were multiple instances throughout the night where she brought out the wrong items or just plain forgot something that we ordered.  A few examples -- my friend asked for more chips and salsa. Never came. He asked again - again, she forgot. Finally, after the third time asking, he got his chips. I was drinking mojitos all night, yet twice she brought me a margarita instead. My hubby asked for corn tortillas for his tacos, but instead he received flour tortillas. Mistake after mistake kept happening, and after awhile it was almost comical. We were her only table, so I'm not sure how she could be so forgetful. So, I have to take off a star for lack of accuracy in fulfilling our requests. That being said though, I will most definitely be back for some more chicken tacos and an IV of mojitos.

Everything was delicious - the chips were still warm, the guac was nice and chunky, and the pico de gallo was a great balance of acidity and tang. I think we could have done with more pico, but that's minor. I had the pollo tacos and pescado tacos and both were great. The pescado was spicy and I had never seen carrots on a taco before, but it worked. The pollo taco had moist meat and a deep flavor. My friend had the camarones taco and the carnitas taco and had glowing things to say about both. I can't really comment on the drinks, since we both just had cans of Tacate, but next time I'm there and don't have to drive, I'll be hitting up a margarita. We both had Mexican ice cream for dessert and it was super creamy and rich.\n\nOur server was great - attentive, friendly, and able to recommend some of her favorites to us. I was nervous to go after reading some of the older comments on Yelp, but I would DEFINITELY go back again.The only thing I would caution against is going when it is very very hot. It was a 90 degree day and there was some air circulating, but I don't think there was any a/c on. I was pretty sweaty by the end of the meal, and so was my friend. I can't believe I'm writing about sweat in a Yelp review...but there it is. Anyway, Verde: you should go.", "user_id": "wPERsqnPFf0ZAHyOTPMCEA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 4}

{"text": "God, I am so conflicted about this restaurant, and not really for reasons related to the food. I'll start with the good and then move on.\n\nThe tacos=good. I like the shrimp tacos especially, which are juicy and have lots of good cabbage dressing and sauce. 3 of them make a fine meal. We also split queso fundido and the elotes--roasted corn with mayo and Oaxaca cheese drizzled with lime juice. Sounds weird--it's great! Definitely try it. The space itself is cute, with glass walls, light wood, and lots of minimalist furniture and funky light fixtures. Like, if *I* were going to run a restaurant, this is how I'd want it to look. The huge amount of glass does turn it into something of a hotbox during the summer months, though, especially as their air conditioning isn't so great. \n\nNow the part that I'm conflicted about. Garfield, the neighborhood Verde is located in, is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh that has struggled economically in the last few decades. Verde, along with Kevin Sousa's Salt of the Earth, are sort of the leading \"anchors\" of Garfield's \"revitalization.\" Verde is located in a beautiful, Modernist apartment building next to a bikram yoga studio, and it definitely caters to a trendy, young, East End-ish clientele. But I wonder if Pittsburghers, in their rush to reclaim their city as a hip and fun place to live, have confused revitalization for gentrification. As I, a young, middle-class white woman, ate my $18 tacos and my $9 queso and my $7 corn and my 2 $8 Palomas seated next to other young middle-class white people, I questioned what the point of a restaurant-as-revitalization is when the \"revitalization\" doesn't seem to be accessible to the majority of the people who actually live in this neighborhood. Verde's demographic seriously does not reflect the demographic of Garfield itself. This is a qualm I also have with Kevin Sousa's presence here, so it's not about Verde specifically. But creating a restaurant that draws outside people to a neighborhood *while still catering to people within the neighborhood* isn't impossible. Kevin Sousa, oddly enough, has managed to do this in East Liberty with Station Street and Union Pig and Chicken. I think Verde probably has an opportunity to be that kind of a place in Garfield, and I wonder if they're taking it. When they do, I'll be truly impressed.", "user_id": "HbLe7TzObCnBo7RUA0WvVg", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "The food is a joke.  I worked as a chef in Arizona and worked in Mexican restaurants there.  This place is not representative.  The black beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.  They put \"simple syrup\" in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.  I asked because I could tell.  \"Simple syrup\" is just sugar and water.  The sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa, and of course we were told \"everyone loves it.\"  Nope.  Not everyone!   In Tucson or Austin that would be thrown against the wall.  The pork and pulled chicken are definitely slow-cooked and tender which is good, but not seasoned well at all.   Also, they do not fold the burritos correctly so you end up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.  The tortillas are clearly not made fresh or on-site and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy mass-marketed at a supermarket.  I'm guessing that the diced tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag pre-diced by their food supplier.  The texture indicates this.  The chips were okay.  They were deep fried corn tortillas but that's nothing new.  You also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where Mexican food is a restaurant staple.  \n\nNo one in Pittsburgh is doing Mexican food right, but I keep looking.  \n\nOverall, Verde has a nice looking space, and the service is okay (at least the day we went), but the food is comical considering it calls itself \"Mexican.\"  It is not representative and this place would do well to send its cooking staff on a trip through Mexico.", "user_id": "jwhM7vdJIsuchnYhlUL7dA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 2}

I was super excited to have this so nearby to provide me comfort when I was missing good Mexican.\n\nThe drinks are excellent, true margaritas made with 100% agave tequilas and *real* triple-sec (Cointreau) - not sour mix or whatever the hell gets marketed as triple-sec that is just like orange flavoring in a plastic jug in the US.\n\nIn the last few months, though, something changed with the food. The taco menu offers only a single vegetarian option, where it used to have like 3. They started charging for salsa. Want a salsa refill? Another $3. What? Could you imagine being charged $3 for ketchup with your fries? This is ridiculous. \n\nThe salsa is tastey, but has way too much fresh garlic in it. You'll taste garlic for 24 hours. I mean, I like garlic, and I like spicy food, but I also want balanced flavor. Perhaps the garlic should be roasted first or something to make it less... astringent and sulfurous. Don't eat here on a date.\n\nI was burping up enchilada and bean dip for like 4 hours after eating. \n\nThe tacos are a bit pricey, but hey, its cheaper than a trip to Mexico or Texas.\n\nOverall, I'd still pick here over, say, Patron (its not even fair to put that in the same category), but it could use some improving and maybe a bit of a review of the pricing.", "user_id": "33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Mad Mex makes my skin crawl (I won't even review it) and Chipotle is...Chipotle. It doesn't even belong in the Mexican food category. Verde on the other hand pleasantly surprised me! I was expecting a less bro-filled and more expensive version of Mad Mex, but it wasn't either of those things. It was an unpretentious, creative take on Mexican cuisine, more upscale than the tiny, family-owned restaurants that will always have a place in my Californian heart, but nevertheless delicious and enjoyable! I would even call it Mexican food, and that's something I haven't been able to say since coming to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and the hostess stood out in particular for her welcoming smile at the door. So few people legitimately smile nowadays. It was appreciated! I started with their mojito and thoroughly enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet, the most common problem I have with mojitos. My roommate, who is ridiculously picky about alcohol, couldn't resist having about a third of it. I didn't mind, since I wanted a completely clear head in order to enjoy our lunch when it arrived. \n\nWe decided to do the family style taco deal, which is two bowls of taco fillings from their taco menu, a side of beans and rice, and six taco shells. For $29, the amount of food we got was quite generous. The beans and rice were small, enough for one side for two people, but the taco fillings could have easily filled eight or nine tacos. We ate the beans and rice, and had two tacos a piece. There were enough leftovers for us each to have another taco plus a pile of taco fillings on the side later that day. We tried the carnitas and the pollo, and both were great. The pollo was nicely sized chunks of chicken, seasoned and grilled with thinly sliced red onions distributed throughout. The carnitas were the real standout though. The pork was perfectly shredded and the green olive, pineapple, and beer flavored salsa was finely minced, giving the entire mixture a really nice texture for a taco filling. The taco wasn't coming apart in my hands and the filling wasn't falling out the back. In short, it was perfect. I'll definitely be back to try their other taco options and to get some more of those carnitas and perhaps another mojito.

{"text": "I've been wanting to pay a visit to Verde for a long while now, and I finally had the opportunity to do so for a (pre-) Valentine's dinner last night, when CM and I were in the vicinity for a make-it-now event across the street at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Never having tried \"modern American Mexican\" before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was quite favorably impressed with the flavors and preparation.\n\nBecause I'd heard so much about the tequila selection, CM and I started off by ordering the featured tequila sampler of the week--tres generaciones ($8)--which consisted of shots of blanco, reposado, and anejo tequilas, as well as sangria.  Despite that these were tequila shots, CM and I split them, and I'm glad that we did, given their strength!  Even the first one (blanco) was stronger than I expected, and CM felt quite tipsy after downing the remainder of the second one (reposado) after I took a sip.  While all of them were good, my favorite was the third (anejo), due to the complexity and depth of its flavor.  Even the sangria was delicious and well-balanced, making for a great palate cleanser.\n\nAs our appetizer, CM and I split an order of chips and salsa with the trio of salsas, which consisted of salsa roja, salsa verde, and pico de gallo ($8).  The red and green salsas were addictive, to the point that I kept munching on them throughout--and after--the meal.  While the pico was fresh, it wasn't as flavorful or complex as the other salsas, but it certainly wasn't bad, either.  The chips were quite good in their own right, too.  This would definitely make a great appetizer to munch on for people just coming for a drink, as well.\n\nFor our entree, CM and I split the family style tacos ($29), which comes with ingredients for six tacos. We chose pescado and carnitas as our proteins and a mix of corn and flour tortillas.  All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious, with a great blend of flavors.  I preferred the fish slightly due to its crisp exterior and light and flaky interior, but the carnitas were pretty good, as well.  I was also pleased with the veggies and beans and rice that came with it, which were cooked well.  The only thing that surprised me was that some of the usual accoutrements for tacos (cheese, sour cream, guac, salsa, etc.) were missing.  This wasn't too much of a problem, though, since the ingredients of the tacos stood on their own, and I was able to add some of the salsas that came with the chips to them.  The only thing that struck me as strange was the spiciness of my first taco, but this turned out to be my own fault, due to having added too much Tabasco sauce (my other tacos, which I didn't add Tabasco to, didn't have this problem!).\n\nMy only substantive criticism is that the service wasn't very attentive, esp. after our food was delivered.  Our waitress didn't come by for at least half an hour after that to ask how the food was or fill our waters.  Several more parties did come in around that time, so she was likely busy attending to them, but it certainly would have been nice not to have to refill my own water glass (luckily, the pitcher was located right next to our table).\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with my (pre-) Valentine's Day meal at Verde.  Sure, it's not the most \"authentic\" Mexican food in PGH (if you're seeking authentic, I'd recommend Casa Reyna or La Palapa), but it's excellent fusion cuisine.

Although their happy hour was pretty limited (2 dollars off house margaritas and a dollar off drafts), we had expected it to be on the pricier side after checking their menu online. \n\nNevertheless, both their food and house margs were well worth the price. We ended up getting the DIY family style tacos with chicken and shrimp, a salsa trio and the guac appetizer. Three of us split all of it, and were comfortably stuffed post-feast. The chicken was juicy, with a hint of spiciness, and the shrimp was coated in a cilantro-lime mayo that I wanted to bottle up and take home. Although it came with 6 tortilla shells, we ended up asking for more because we still had chicken and shrimp left in the bowls! Also, their guac and salsas were on point. I'm not typically a fan of salsa verde (the green one) but thoroughly enjoyed this one. It had a little more kick than they normally do. The guac was so good, we ended up getting two. \n\nThe margs were only $5.5 during happy hour, and the bartender didn't skimp on the tequila. It was one of the more tastier margaritas I've had in the 'Burgh, and it was only their house version! I'm looking to head back to check out their speciality margs and their infused tequilas.

{"text": "I was with a large party of 8 and we shared chips and salsa and guacamole, very tasty. I had three margaritas, which sounds like a lot, but these were pretty small drinks for $7.50 a pop.  Everyone really enjoyed their tacos and sides. I got the special of two cod tacos with rice and beans. One taco and a side are more than enough to fill me up. I will definitely be back to try out their jackfruit taco and kale salad side, but  I won't be getting another margarita here, way too pricey for the amount you receive. \n\nAlso, they were unable to split up our bill and I had cash, but didn't receive change since they took the cash off the top... So I ended up overpaying by about 5 bucks, no biggie, but still... \n\nSo overall great food and I really want to come back once it warms up and try out there patio, it looks awesome!

{"text": "My wife and I had dinner on Saturday evening. We started with some drinks. My mojito and my wife's sangria were excellent. Unfortunately, the drinks ended up being the highlight of the evening. For an appetizer, we had queso fundido, which consisted of a lot of melted cheese, a few jalape\u00f1o peppers and an occasional roasted red pepper.  I found it lacking flavor, especially considering the amount of calories that must have been in the thing. The cheese was very chewy and my mouth actually got tired of chewing. For entrees, I had one of the night's specials, short rib enchiladas and my wife had the chicken enchiladas. We had to send them back initially because they were cold. (To Verde's credit, they comped half of the appetizer to compensate.) The short ribs enchiladas were good, except that they were small and had very little short rib. They were mostly potatoes and carrots. My wife had the chicken enchiladas. They were fine.  Overall, a solid three stars. However, one must consider the cost. My meal was $18 and my wife's was $16 - pretty expensive for Mexican food that was only slightly better than your local Mexican restaurant that serves $5 lunch specials consisting of two nicely sized enchiladas, plus a mound of beans and rice.", "user_id": "ClxfNd4eQthoJdTN8bQjPA", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

{"text": "As East Liberty continues to gentrify, we add more and more good food locations to the area, something that makes me incredibly happy. Right next to the prominent NACL [Salt] in Garfield on Penn Avenue, you can find Verde, an installment by the creators of Tender in Lawrenceville.\n\nMexican themed, and centered around tequila, this place is unassuming and fresh, with an open floor plan and a cute summer patio. The restaurant is surrounded in glass, which helps towards the open feeling. My brother and i made it here for brunch on a Sunday, a rare enough occasion, being in the area after having returned the carpet steamer to Giant Eagle. Brunch is served until 3 pm and you also get a $1 off each glass of sangria. As a realm of new experiences Phil actually ordered his first sangria and was pleasantly surprised. [Phil is not a drinker...  {included in other new experiences: Guacamole and chopping off his 2 ft long hair}]. Additionally we ordered the guacamole. Phil is no avocado person, however, even he admitted that is was delicious. YAY.\n\nFor the actual menu, Phil ordered the Chilaquiles which looked scrumptious [he especially liked the fried egg it came with] and i ordered the Huevos Benedictos on my never-ending quest for my city favorite. They were petite, made with bacon,\nbutternut squash, caramelized onion, and a guajillo-hollandaise. While the butternut squash was well done, the hollandaise sauce was too spicy for the dish, completely drowning the caramelized onions and the bacon, which was there more for texture than taste. Also there was too much of the sauce downing the remaining dish. \n\nFor service, the waitress was beyond helpful and attentive, checking in on us every 10 minutes or so, asking us for feedback and making sure we were comfortable. Thinking back this was something I experience less. I'm a simple person who never needs much unless I'm very annoyed yet I noticed she was readily available if you did.\n\nI haven't been back to this establishment for what they are known for -- their tequila flights and evening items since the restaurant first opened, so I look forward to another good meal when I next get back to Garfield.", "user_id": "csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ", "business_id": "ffVx7PrC2JSfOq_DTW-vZQ", "stars": 3}

The chips and salsa were great. The guacamole is pre-made, and over processed (no chunks of avocado) for my taste. For the $9 price, I have had much better fresh, table-side preparation guacamole in California, Las Vegas, etc.\n\nI wanted fish tacos but the only fish is tilapia, and no other fish is available. So the server strongly recommended the seviche special which as mahi. I also ordered the TOSTADAS DE FRIJOLES. The tostadas was ok, but did not have much flavor, and it was really difficult to eat the corn shell that was so hard to cut. The seviche was terrible. I tasted one bite and it had the taste and texture of old fish, with no flavor. I let two other people at the table taste it, and they had the same reaction. I never send food back, but I did tell the server that it was bad and she took it off of our bill.\n\nAn even bigger disappointment was the service overall. It was really slow, and the food came out at different times for the 9 of us. Some people ordered tacos and asked for sour cream when the ordered, but sat and waited for quite a while after their tacos were delivered to actually get the sour cream. It also took a very long time to just get our check.\n\nEveryone was frustrated by the service, and since I suggested having dinner there, I promised to do the yelp review.

Quite a large space with ample seating inside, about a dozen or so seats around the bar and a nice sized patio outside.  Some of the outdoors seats are under an umbrella and some are not.  There were heaters on the patio too, so I am assuming that outside seating is still available on cooler days/evenings.\n\nWe had a reservation, but it was not overly crowded so I do not think you need one if you are heading there for brunch.  There were two menus, the restaurant week menu and the standard menu.  Both looked really good.  The standard menu, more of a American-Mexican vibe, had french toast, steak and eggs, salad, burritos, fish tacos, english muffins and a egg & tortilla chip dish.  They also have sides of chips and salsa with some options for guacamole.  In addition, they also have a select menu of  brunch drinks, including sangria, margaritas and bloody mary's.

Very good mix of flavors, nothing overpowering or standing out significantly, all the flavors blended well!\n\nIn addition to the brunch cocktails, they have a highly extensive list of tequila and mescal.  They do have some other bourbon, scotch, rum, gin and vodka choices.  For me, I was very interested in trying a flight of tequila.

{"text": "I may have to start every Mexican restaurant review with a warning: I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I sure did tear up the burrito I ordered!  Translation...I thought it was amazing!\n\nFor a burrito to please me, it needs to be big (this was huge!) and have delicious and flavorful ingredients.  I ordered the shrimp burrito and the first thing I noticed was that there was a ton of shrimp in it and they seemed to be fresh and not frozen.  I love me some sauces and I think that really topped it off for me because the queso sauce inside was incredible!  There was also loads of rice, peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  The only issue was that it was TOO stuffed and the whole thing fell apart.  I didn't really mind, considering I just ripped it apart with a fork and demolished it!\n\nSo now that you know I'm a fan of the burrito, I have to also talk about how the chips were definitely freshly baked and probably some of the best chips I've ever had.  I realize that normally people want a kick to their salsa, but since I end up crying after a couple bites of something hot, the mild salsa was just right for me.  I also love chunky salsa, and this fit the bill.  The gauc was whipped and not chunky at all.  I was a little surprised, but I still thought it was good.  \n\nI just wish this place wasn't on Route 51.  How awful is 51 with the traffic??

{"text": "As a San Diego native that moved to Pittsburgh over two years ago, I want to say:  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!  I've been craving a Carne Asada Burrito ever since I left home and you guys satisfy me.\n\nEvery time I mention Mexican food/burritos shops to a Pittsburgher, I cringed when they recommend Qdoba, Chipotle, or Mad Mex.  For $8 at these places I get a big burrito stuffed with fillers (beans, rice, veg).  For $6 at CTS, I can a big burrito of stuffed with primarily MEAT.\n\nIf you're going to try something here, try the Carne Asada Burrito.  It is a must at least once.  The California Burrito and the Carne Asada Fries are also good recommendations too.  Oh man, there is so much I want to come back and try.  They also have the two bottles of hot sauce and a sandwich pouch of marinated/pickled carrots, just like home :)\n\nEverything about this place screams home.  People might say it has tacky decorations but this is how a taco shop in San Diego would look like.  This place is also clean.  It felt like home as I sat in the big booth, watching morning talk shows on the LCD TV, and dumping loads and loads of hot sauce on my Carne Asada Burrito.\n\nWhile dining in, other California natives came in and were happy to find the place.  I also had a nice talk with the people there too.  They were super friendly.  GIVE THEM ALL YOUR BUSINESS, so they can open a second store near Shadyside *hint hint.*  Maybe I'm bias but living in Pittsburgh just got a little bit happier with this place in town.  \n\nFYI, Google Maps didn't find the exact location.  I was a few blocks off.  Just look for the huge white/baby blue Whitehall Tire Service building.  CTS is right across from it.", "user_id": "fVnY5R9Wx8nhER6iWhcrsA", "business_id": "veoBudGo99JLNVT0Gj2Slw", "stars": 5}

The three stars represents the overall rating of all similar restaurants I've experienced including ones out West.\n\nFriendly service, and the tacos were decent but not incredible. I had a chicken taco which wasn't too bad, although I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the toppings. The guacamole, for example, was not very good. I also got a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, and bacon. The bacon was undercooked and rubbery and they didn't even bother to chop it up.\n\nOverall, I would say this is a decent place, but nothing special.

I've been dying for a joint that I can go and get some taco truck/taco stand style dishes without having to get on a plane or fight for a parking spot in the strip, and CTS is the perfect place for that. The staff is super friendly. The owner's wife asked us if we were from out of town since we didn't ask a million questions about the menu haha, which led into her telling us the story of the shop. I guess her husband moved here 9 years ago from San Diego and was disappointed in the lack of authentic taco shops, so he opened his own.\n\nThe food was awesome. I got the #6, which included a beef taco, a tostada, and a taquito, then i got two extra shredded chicken tacos. I could hardly finish it. Their guac and pico were both really tasty. My boyfriend got a beef/bean burrito and a fish taco for there, and a jalapeno burrito for later at home, which he said was better than his other dishes.

But along came the California Taco Shop with their wide assortment of tacos, tostadas, burritos and enchiladas. \n\nWhen it comes to choosing your meat, skip the generic grilled chicken.

If you're truly adventurous, get the lengua (tongue) or tripas (tripe). \n\nBut the bottom line is: big burritos stuffed to the brim with flavorful and well-cooked meat, cheap prices, friendly service, casual atmosphere, spicy homemade hot sauces, crema. Yum. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Mexican dishes, they have wikipedia articles printed throughout the restaurant explaining everything from a taco to carnitas to a California Burrito.\n\nThis a casual joint that's a great addition to a bleak stretch of 51.

The rice was much better than any other local mexican restaurant, but the refried beans were nothing special.  It was very satisfying.  The drink choices were canned sodas or bottles of jarritos.  They also had a sangria flavored soda but they were out.  The owner offered to give us the display bottle, but my wife settled for the jarriots instead.

{"text": "I notice a few reviewers out there having the \"is it authentic?\" debate when it comes to Mexican restaurants. My first concern with Mexican food is the same as it is with any cuisine, and that's \"is it good?\". It's just as easy to make bad Mexican food as it is any other food, but I find so much of it out there, both here in Pittsburgh and in the rest of the country. So much so, in fact, that I had decided to write off eating at Mexican restaurants unless I'm in Chicago, NYC or So Cal, as I've been disappointed so often. The reviews here on Yelp made me think things might be different here at Cal. Taco Shop. Not.\nI started with chips and salsa. The chips were a little greasy, but not really bad...it's the salsa that had me shaking my head. It reminded me of a can of RO*TEL diced tomatoes with green chiles dumped into a molcajete. I don't know to what extent this salsa is homemade, but it seemed to me not at all. They do offer three different pureed salsas at a table where you pick up your fork and napkin, and I found the salsa verde to be alright. I used that on my chips. I ordered chicken enchiladas in mole for my main. Most of us in this country know mole as chocolate sauce, but they can be best defined as chile based sauces thickened with nuts and seeds. These sauces are different all over Mexico, as regional cuisine in that country has stayed really well preserved. Mexican chocolate is used as a flavoring ingredient in some moles, but, when used, is one of up to 80 ingredients that go into the sauce. The mole that most restaurants here in the U.S. attempt to replicate is mole rojo, which hails from the state of Oaxaca. When done right, it's nutty and spicy with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. The mole at California Taco Shop was very one note and overly sweet. There's a ready to use mole paste in a jar out there, Dona Maria Mole Adobo from Hormel, that tastes and looks alot like this mole. My conjecture is that many restaurants use it, as making mole is an all day affair. I don't know if that's what they're doing here, but I am saying that this mole tastes like that. They top their enchiladas in mole with queso anejo, which was the only good thing about them. The refried beans were flavorless and uninteresting. I would say that I'll go back and try other dishes here, but I didn't dine alone, so saw some of the other offerings. It's just not good quality food. It's not being prepared with care, and the ingredients are sub par. They may make their own tortillas, but mine were buried in bad mole, so I can't comment on their attributes. Not. Going.

{"text": "This isn't a question of taste or all the other places I have eaten at that serve this fare.  This is simply a question of food quality and preparation.  I won't even go into the far departure from authentic in this review.\n\nThe chips and salsa were inedible.  The chips were stale and oversalted.  The \"salsa\" tasted like the tomato and chile mixture you get in a can and was too watery to be scooped by a chip.  This was the worst I have been served anywhere.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  The flour tortilla was pretty nice.  The filling was mostly chicken and it didn't taste grilled.  Grilled to me is over a flame.  That aside, it was to come with guacamole and there wasn't any in there at all.  I was expecting rice and beans but none there either.  There was a scant amount of pico, lettuce and tomato.  I tried dousing it with the tomatillo salsa but it didn't do much and the other 2 salsas offered were just ground up chiles which I found to be ridiculous.  The lack of effort and interest here was astounding.  There was a lake of some sort of liquid at the bottom of my basket when I was finished.  Was this from the pico?  I can't even believe I had to eat here.\n\nI tried some of my wife's mole and was really super glad I didn't order that dish.  The 2 enchiladas were supposed to come with rice and beans.  She didn't get them so went up to buy a portion of beans.  They looked and tasted as if they had come out of a can.\n\nI ordered a chicken taco after because I was still hungry and desperate to find an edible menu item.  The counter person asked me if I wanted everything.  This included lettuce, tomato, cheese, pico, guac or sour cream.  None of these things should be put on a chicken taco.  I asked her why they didn't come with cilantro and onions as they should and she said that the locals would rather have the other ingredients and offered to send it out as I pleased.  This was nice but telling.  The taco would have been average but the tortillas were terrible and oil soaked and again the same grilled chicken was uninspired at best.  \n\nGo try Vicky's Mexican Restauant, come back here and tell me you're still a fan or that you think it's as good as it gets.  The only place worse than this is Jose and Tony's.

{"text": "I've been here dozens of times. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant by any stretch. But it's solidly average, it's close to my house, and sometimes I'm wildly lazy and don't feel like trekking far to stuff my face with copious amounts of free chips. So I keep slinking back to Patron for an adequate but not outstanding meal.\n\nThe first few times I went here, I sampled several chicken dishes that had their shredded, seasoned chicken in them (e.g., chicken flautas, chicken enchiladas). I found the texture of the shredded meat to be tough, stringy and chewy -- very off putting. So I started steering clear of anything with the shredded meat, and now I usually get their \"pollo amigo\" entree, which consists of chicken breast strips over a bed of rice topped with their cheese sauce. It's fairly tasty (the meat in this dish doesn't have any texture issues), although they could stand to be more generous with the cheese sauce. It's not overly spiced or flavorful, but it's generally decent (and that's pretty much how I would describe everything I've ever eaten here -- decent but not amazing).\n\nService can be hit or miss depending on what section you're in. I've always been seated right away (it's rarely busy in there), and free chips and salsa have always been delivered to our table with haste.  But beyond that, you can't always count on your server to promptly take your order, fill your drink, or check up on you with any regularity. It just really depends on the day.\n\nGiven the food quality and service, I think that they are probably priced on the high side.

I happened to overhear some people talking at the coffee shop who stopped for lunch at Casa Rasta, and were raving about the tacos.

When you walk inside, the small dining/waiting area is completely clean and organized, if a bit plain.  You definitely know you're in for quick take out or a fast meal.  But it will be a fantastic fast meal.  The owners, the two Rastas in question, have taken the taco to wonderful heights.  \n\nCorn taco shells are standard for the tacos, with larger flour shells for the burritos.  Their menu is small, but potent.  On this first visit, myself and my lovely eating partner had a mix and match of the Pulled Pork, Citrus Marinated Fried Pork, Chorizo, and Jamaican Jerk Chicken tacos....and they each blew our minds.  Filled with a good helping of meat, each taco comes with cilantro, onions, and a bit of shredded lettuce.  The meats are all perfectly seasoned.  My personal favorites were the Fried Pork, which had its own special pepper sauce, and the Jerk Chicken, which had a mango salsa that will blow your mind.\n\nThere are also beef, steak, and two vegetarian options.  Any of the fillings can be made in taco, tostada, burritos, tortas, or quesadillas.  The prices are good with with Tacos being $2.50 and Burritos being $6.  There's none of that price up charging for extras, as has become the norm in many places.  They also have weekend specials and homemade salsas.\n\nFantastic food, good prices, nice people.  It's all you could ask for.  Well, maybe a credit card machine.

I really wanted a shrimp one, but there are no seafood options on the menu.  The other menu option missing is fresh tortilla chips.  Total bummer considering they bring you a fantastic spread of regular salsa, salsa verde and jalapeno's.  I could have used something to dip in it!  So the next option was to slather my burrito in it.  \n\nI thought the burrito itself was good, but definitely not a giant one you'd get at Cali Taco Shop or Reyna's in the strip.  It's more of a taco size, you'll need more than one if you have a big American appetite like I do!  The steak was a little too salty for my taste, but was cooked just right.  The rice was really the winner of the burrito.  It had just the right amount of lime added.  Loved it!  \n\nWould I go back?  Sure, why not.

The jerk chicken was kind of grey and didn't have any jerk flavors, it was topped by unripened mango.  It was supposed to be a fresh mango salsa I guess but the flavors didn't mesh and it was just awful.  I tried it with the salsas but couldn't recommend either of these insipid and flavorless imposters.  Were they sitting around too long and did everything need salt?  There was too much wrong with all of it to sort it out.\n\nThe pork was ok, there wasn't enough of it.  Neither salsa really complimented it.  It was swallowed by the flavorful double corn tortilla that housed both tacos.  These were obviously made locally and fresh but were heavier than I am used to.\n\nI can't recommend eating here and I will not be back.  Can I go back to Chicago now?

Just wish they had a seating area, because in Winter if I walk down there my tacos would be cold by the time I get back to my office and parking down there can be difficult.  But it is just a cart on the street in front of a Mexican mini market so I can't complain.  The workers don't always speak much English but you can just point to what meat you want and all the meats are so delicious.  They have varieties of ground beef, ribeye, two kinds of pork, and chicken, and a fajita mix.  One of the best features is their salsa bar which has many delicious salsas and fresh lime and cilantro that you can try all of if you would like.  It's extremely cheap but I think it is cash only.

I slathered my tacos in the salsas, liberally applied pico, grabbed a few limes and a grilled pepper.  Then I walked down the road to enjoy my lunch.  What happened next was mouth blowing. \n\nI placed the taco in my mouth and took a bite.  Sheer pleasure.  After all the crappy Mexican food I've had here, this was a revelation.  The zing of the onions, the softness of the corn tortillas, the kick of the salsas.  I took another bite.  I was in heaven for a few seconds.   Until my mouth exploded in FIRE and went to straight to hell.  Holy Jesus!  If Satan made a salsa, the habenero would be it.  It was so sinful.  My face started to burn up and snot began to drip uncontrollably out my nostrils.  I must have looked like a disaster.  I polished off my first taco but had to pick at my second because I was hyperventilating like no ones business.  I downed my Jumex juice in a matter of seconds and then sprinted to the nearest store to buy a much needed bottle of water.  OMG OMG OMG.  So much pain and pleasure at the same time.  \n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, habenero salsa here is a 9.3.

The guys who work the grill kindly gave me a bag to help us carry our tacos and shield them from the rain.  The chicken was delicious--tender and moist--and the guac was thick and creamy, and the tortilla shell added a nice crisp crunch.  The pork was a little salty, but was still good.  I washed it down with a bottle of pineapple Jarritos, whose sweetness served as a foil for the savory goodness of the tacos.  They were so good, there were no words exchanged between my friend and I as we greedily gobbled them up.

{"text": "Do you hear that? That's the sound of every broke college student squealing in ecstasy over TACOS FOR $2.50. Come hungry, because these are filling. You can order as many tacos as you want (though three makes for a heavy meal), with as many toppings at you want. Let me repeat, FOR $2.50. I want to emphasize that the appeal does not lie only in the price. I'm unashamed to say Las Palmas has made up a considerable part of my diet for the past year, and I've consistently been impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients. \n\nI suggest mixing it up - try a different meat for each taco base (there's usually a selection of 5-6), and challenge your taste buds with their range of salsas and fresh toppings. Brace yourself, they mean business with the spicy salsas. \n\nWarning - It's a stand, not a restaurant, and offers no seating, so you'll have to take your tacos on the go. But despite being covered by only a small awning, Las Palmas is opened year round. (Yes, even when Pittsburgh becomes an arctic wasteland.) \n\nOverall: believe the hype.

Everything in Shadyside was crazy packed. However, we weren't in a rush to get anywhere so that didn't bother us too much. We put our names on a the list for a table and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, they seated us at a table that had a speaker situated about 2 feet above it. As loud as they were playing their music, this was not cool. I saw a couple leaving the bar so we snagged their seats instead.\n\nThe bar area is neat and reminds me of one of my favorite bars back in Florida (Monkey Bar in Orlando!). The open air design is very nice. The bar was packed, which was not surprising as it definitely has the best seats in the house, besides the rooftop.\n\nI've read and heard of others complaining about the service and it was no different when we visited.

It was crunchy. They should also greatly consider double wrapping their shells. While tasty, those things do not hold up at all. It's no fun eating a taco with a fork.

I went to dinner with 10 of my friends on Saturday night and we all had an awful experience.\n\nAmbiance - the decor is nice...very modern, clean, and urban though it is quite possibly the loudest restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh.  Granted it was a Saturday night, but we were forced to scream at one another just in our normal conversations.  \n\nService - given our large party size, we should have had 2 servers, though we had one frazzled and sadly under-trained waitress.  Steel Cactus also doesn't seem to have busboys, which would improve this experience.  It took us about 20 minutes to get drinks - and I'm talking about water and Diet Cokes in addition to margaritas.  Also I ordered a bottle of wine that never came (in fact the server just disappeared and forgot about it altogether)...the only saving grace was that it didn't appear on my bill. \n\nFood/Drinks - half our table liked their margaritas, while several others sent theirs back as they were terrible.  I got a vodka and soda and the soda was flat...and even their beers on tap were flat, so I think they just had issues that night.  I had a carne asada steak, which for $12.50 was a steal, but you could tell that it was old poor quality meat that was graying on the counter prior to it being cooked.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't go back to Steel Cactus as there are better venues with mediocre/good Mexican food and better service and ambiance like Round Corner Cantina or Verde.", "user_id": "s_MADZKa8lPwsUelLGAZfg", "business_id": "0QkkNagJaWllynycTF-fRQ", "stars": 1}

I feel like my experience at most Mexican restaurants can be predicted by my experience with the guacamole, and this held true at Steel Cactus. The gauc was neither good nor bad - while the avocado seemed fresh, the flavor wasn't great, and the guac itself was pretty bland. I had the soup of the day - Lobster Bisque - as that is one of my favorite soups. There was quite a bit of lobster in it, but the flavor was lacking. I also had the chance to try the Chicken Soup, which had a bit of a kick, but I still wasn't particularly impressed. The Veggie Burrito was decent, although again, nothing that left me wanting me. \n\nAll of that being said, I would still come back because the venue is so incredible.

The atmosphere was very cool and there's a pretty rad fan they have going over the bar that kind of gives the deck a cozy industrial vibe.  Is that possible?  It might not be, all I know is it looked cool and I liked it.\n\nWhen we were seated the table next to us was RAVING about their food, so much so I thought someone must have been rude to the waitress and was trying to make up for it or something, but then the I overheard the one girl say the fajitas changed her life, so at that point I was pretty much set on fajitas.\n\nOur server, Alex, was really nice.  We started out with the chipotle salsa and chips.  I've NEVER had a salsa that tasted like that, and it was AWESOME.  It almost tasted like it was made from green tomatos or tomatillos.  It was somehow sour, and sweet at the same time w a kick from the chipotle.\n\nI am pretty much obsessed with it.  Its so good I'm convinced it could cure cancer, and I swear after eating it my skin was clearer, my hair looked inexplicably awesome, and my dining companion was 50% more handsome.\n\nThis may also have been because I'd had a yinzerita.  Those things are fantastic, but one will get you wasted so be careful, it is a sipping tea!  \n\nThe fajitas were excellent, the girl sitting to my left didn't lie!  The best part about the fajitas were the roasted red peppers that came with it.  My friend had the chicken enchiladas and he thought they were excellent.  They were pretty good.\n\nThe only thing about Steel Cactus is all the food is pretty salty, so you may want to go easy on the hot sauces so as not to overwhelm the food completely.\n\nOtherwise, it was great.

Service was quick in asking what we would like to drink. On a side note, it is interesting for a Mexican Cantina to have a low selection of Mexican beers, and being hispanic and new here from California it is sad when the waitresses has trouble pronouncing them, not to say she wasn't nice, our waitress was very friendly. \n\nFor the meals, the menu was a bit limited, pretty much tacos and burritos were the option to eat with a couple different selections. Missing an assortment of authentic meals that come to mind. \nWe ended up ordering a Mango and Shrimp civiche appetizer which tasted a bit different from normal civiche but it was definitely a flavorful experience. After looking over the menu, we ended up going for the shrimp and Carne Asada meal and what I believe called the chicken burrito de muerte (named for its \"spiceyness\"). The food was from ok to pretty good. The Carne Asada plate has very good sauce poured on top of the shrimp and steak and it overall was cooked great and tasted wonderful, For some reason they grilled onions and left a big pile on one side of the plate, kind of confusing, didn't seem to go with the carne asada or the mexican rice with the plate, maybe a better idea if they chose to put a side of beans instead. \nThe burrito was stuffed with rice and cheese, and could have used a lot more shredded chicken but it has a good taste. Came with chipotle sauce and sour cream. And for being a burrito de muerte, I sensed no spice at all, this opinion seconded by my pregnant wife. Though the chipotle was delightful. \n\nOf the three options for dessert, we went with the deef fried banana cheesecake with vanilla ice cream. The appearance was nice and totally through us off, we thought we were served chimichangas. Ended up the dessert was great! Very sweet and flavorful, went great with the ice cream. \n\nOverall with a great atmosphere and shopping near by, I would suggest coming for sit down dinner or lunch during the week.

I ordered the Taco Burrito and I'm not sure I've ever made a better decision. I love tacos. I love burritos. Combine the two and I'm pretty much really excited. The beef was seasoned deliciously, the rice was tasty, there was cheese and beans, sour cream and lettuce and diced tomatoes. I'm the kind of person who just keeps going 'Mmmmm' with delight when something tastes good and YO that was happening with this burrito. It was a little messy to eat since the sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes were on the side, but I'm sure it's so the lettuce doesn't get soggy and the sour cream doesn't melt all over. I'd still devour another one gladly, messy hands and all. The more I think about it the more I decide that I'll be returning for another burrito when the craving strikes. For some reason it's so hard to get a decent ground beef burrito and I'm so glad to have found this one. Am I sounding like a whack job? SHUP it was just a really good burrito, okay? The rest of my par-tay was very pleased with their meals as well (another burrito and tacos were ordered), and they were raving about their margs, which were on special for $5 for cinco de mayo weekend.\n\nMy only advice on this place (other than ORDER THE FRIGGIN TACO BURRITO)  is to avoid it at all costs after 8 PM. It seems to get boisterous from what I can tell walking by on an evening stroll. Unless you're looking to get belligerent on Yinzeritas. Then this place will be perfect for you.\n\nOh oh oh and also, I did want to comment on the staff's garb. I think it's a requirement to wear short shorts for the female waitresses, which I find pretty distasteful but, um, America, eff yeah, or something like that.

{"text": "This was my message to the manager..I wanted to message whomever and tell you that your food is excellent. The service on the other hand is not. I am not one to complain and I will make this brief. My boyfriend and I went to your establishment around 10 pm Saturday night. We were seated by the hostess table and sat there for quite a while. I looked, made eye contact, and smiled at a server but after watching her walk by us four times I realized she wasn't our server. While waiting to get her attention prior to ordering many other tables were sat. The server eventually came over and asked what we would like to order. This server was indeed the same girl that I attempting to get service from initially. She apologized and was happy to take our order. I ordered queso, a pollo burrito without pico and and a yinzarita. She promptly came back with the queso and informed me that it was going to be about 15 minutes to make my drink. She then asked if I wanted something else. I said no and that I would wait.  There were three females who also ordered yinzaritas. I know they were seated after us because I thought about asking to be moved to that table. We got our food and I still had not received my drink. The server did come over once more and tell me it would be a few more minutes. I had pretty much finished my food and I realized the girls at the other table were all sipping yinzaritas. After a few minutes the server came back again, said it would only be a few more minutes and I asked her to just cancel my order.  I mentioned the girls having their drinks to my boyfriend and he (being passive as always) said, yeah, I was hoping you didn't notice that. I didn't ask for a manager or complain to the server I just wanted out of the restaurant. That was the second time eating at Steel Cactus and we had issues with rude staff before. The manager was more than polite but it doesn't make up for a bad experience. We will not be coming back to your restaurant.

{"text": "I gave this place an extra star because the atmosphere is great and has the potential to be really nice. But everything else was pretty comically bad.\n\nI arrived with two other other people around 7 on a Thursday. We asked the two hostesses if there was seating on the deck. We were told it would be a half hour wait. I thought well, okay, we can wait and just get a drink at the downstairs bar first. \n\nWe ordered drinks and before our beers were even poured we were told a table was open. This would normally just be a result of good luck if it weren't for the fact that there were about 5 open tables when we went up there. This tells me that the hostesses had no grasp on what was really going on. Why have two if one is not keeping track of your biggest draw during the warm months; the upstairs deck?\n\nWe were all starving. The menu is sort of lacking any creativity so it was difficult to make a choice, My party ordered the carne asade tacos, a carne asade burrito and the fajita burrito. \n\nIt took a little while for the food to come out, but nothing bad because it was sort of busy. The people in my party that had the carne asade dishes complained that the steak was chewy and rubbery. My fajita burrito, was perhaps the worst burrito I have ever gotten. I would rank it below chipolte, taco bell, 7-11 frozen burritos.\n\nIssues with the burrito\n\n(1) There was hardly any chicken in it. It was basically a tortilla filled with bland and generally undercooked rice and peppers and onions\n\n(2) The chicken that was there was disgusting. You would expect a fajita chicken burrito to have, I dunno, grilled chicken in it. This seemed to be shredded chicken or canned chicken. It was difficult to discern because there was so little to investigate. Maybe it is better when there is more a spoonful in it? Not sure.\n\n(3) the vegetables were probably microwaved. Well I do not know that for sure. There were no sear marks to be seen. Onions change appearance when cooked. A shortcut was taken somewhere. Maybe they were just warmed quickly in a skillet. I hope its not just a massive pile of onions and peppers in a prep bin!\n\nDespite all that I polished off the entire thing because I was starving. I told the waitress it was terrible and she said sorry and asked if it was the pulled chicken in the burrito. Why don't the servers know what is in the food? Every place I ever worked at had all the servers sample each meal before starting. \n\nThe food was so gross. It is a shame that the bar next door that has a small kitchen mainly for wings and hoagies has better mexican food (quesadillas and tacos) than a place that is marketed as a mexican restaurant.\n\nThis seems like a place that had all the money in the world to design it nicely, but is not being run by anyone that even has the slightest grasp on food service and definitely has no one of any pedigree making the recipes for the food. Or maybe it was just a bad night. But you know how first impressions go...\n\nMy advice to the DeSimones is to hire someone that actually is trained in culinary to make the menu, and to hire someone to run the place that understands basic concepts on how to run a restaurant. I only worked food service for two years and noticed too many things wrong to name. I would think anyone that has served at a chain restaurant for a year or two would be able to make some of the changes needed for this place to even be remotely run like a real restaurant.\n\nOr maybe this place is making money hand over fist based on atmosphere?", "user_id": "4nb2kePC91_GutcXHxG66Q", "business_id": "0QkkNagJaWllynycTF-fRQ", "stars": 2}

The space is really cool, and the menu is very promising, but the execution just doesn't quite work out and we ended up disappointed.\n\nWe ordered:\n--chips and gringo salsa:  shouldn't chips and salsa be free?  That gripe aside, these were quite good.  The salsa had a nice favor and good kick from the jalape\u00f1os, and the chips tasted fresh.\n--fish tacos:  \"Grilled Mahi, red onion confit, pineapple, avocado, cilantro, & cayenne lime crem\u00e8\" sounds amazing, and it almost was, except they burnt the fish.  I'll give them points for the idea, but it didn't quite work out.\n--chipotle brisket tacos:  another dish that sounded fantastic but then just wasn't.  I tried a bite of my husband's lunch-- the barbecue sauce was fantastic and the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch, but the meat itself tasted oddly like bacon and not at all like slow-cooked brisket.\n--rice and beans: came with both tacos.  Nothing extraordinary, but no complaints.\n--Pacifico: I'll give props to anywhere that carries my favorite Mexican beer, but lime and a glass would've been nice.\n\nAlso-- do they have breakfast, or brunch on Saturdays?  There was a bloody mary bar, but we didn't get a brunch menu.  Then I heard someone at the table next to us ordering a breakfast burrito, and was kind of disappointed because that probably would have been my order.\n\nOn the bright side, the prices are reasonable, the service is good and I'm a fan of the neighborhood.

And if you want to do meat substitutes, seitan and tempeh are way better in the context of a taco or burrito.  If you are absolutely set on doing tofu, crumble it (a la Chipotle). Cubes of tofu do not have the right texture at all for a Mexican dining experience.\n\nGiven my background, I order instead the 3 peppers burrito, which is always solid.

{"text": "Steel Cactus is not a Mexican restaurant because it doesn't serve real food. Their food tastes like plastic. Even their chips are gross-- how do you mess up tortilla chips?! I do like the open-air space and cute decor, and have been for drinks a few times. The drinks have always been made well and are tasty, but are seriously overpriced compared to other bars in the area. Every time I have come, I have had to deal with staff with attitudes. Most recently, I had not one, but TWO unpleasant incidents. On a Saturday night around 9:00 PM as things started to get busy, I was ordering from a female bartender who was moving around while listening and ended up next to her coworker, causing me to talk across him (he was taking orders from other customers). The male bartender (shorter guy with piercings, I believe) very rudely snapped at me and was like SHUT UP AND WAIT YOUR TURN, I'M HELPING SOMEONE ELSE. I was appalled that he would talk to a customer like this to begin with, much less one that wasn't even talking to him. I informed him that I was talking to his coworker and that was that. About an hour later, things started to get too wild for my group, so we went to close out our tabs. When I got my bill, I almost toppled out of my bar stool. There were charges for things I did not order and the drinks that I ordered that were on special did not have the discount applied. The girl said her manager decided to cut off the special, but since I had been there for hours and was not aware, they would honor it. I was willing to wait for the manager to come take care of the extra items and drink prices, but luckily the bartender was able to take care of it on her own. So she said/so I thought. Thank goodness I saved my receipt, because when I checked my credit card charges two days later, there was a separate charge for the amount that she \"took off\" my bill. Rather than remove the items from the check, in an effort to get me to leave and free up the bar stool quicker, she split them off onto a separate check and ran my card twice, only giving me the one receipt for the correct amount. I did call and speak with the manager, who was very understanding and refunded me the unauthorized charges immediately. I am glad the situation was remedied, but I am shocked by the dishonesty and disrespect exhibited by the bar staff at Steel Cactus.

One of the six had ordered an appetizer for her entree and it came out ahead of the other food about 15 minutes later, and it was cold and awful (empanadas). At this point we were considering leaving. Another 10 minutes or so passed and the rest of the food came out. We also told the waitress that the appetizer came out cold and she asked if we wanted to send it back. We did not have another hour to wait for the food to be remade. The rest of the food was pretty good though! Among us, we had burritos, tacos, etc. and we all enjoyed the food. When the bill came, I would have thought they might take off the appetizer given the wait and it was cold, but no such luck. Better service would have led to a much better review. The waitress was very nice, but it did not make up for the long wait and food that was good, but certainly not great. Also, I know this place has changed restaurants multiple times over the years, but it does not appear have been renovated in the least.", "user_id": "Yutffkp2D18GmNE4BTjVzQ", "business_id": "PZAQwvTRnVtqbaC8tZMx6w", "stars": 2}
{"text": "We had been planning on trying Cinco for awhile, but we were hesitant after reading some of the reviews regarding the less-than-stellar service.  So our second choice was to stop by Cinco on a Friday evening after our first choice had too long of a wait.  And we are glad we did.  Whatever service problems that may existed early on, there's no evidence of those problems now. (Note that most of the \"poor service\" reviews were shortly after they opened.) Our waiter was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive.  Yes, he was busy and had plenty of tables but it didn't affect us: our young children would have made sure to let us know if the service took too long.  Our food was very good.  The fish tacos were as good as any as I've had and even typical sides like rice and refried beans, which I don't typically expect all that much from, tasted remarkably good.  Somebody earlier complained about the chips and salsa but we loved them.  The chips were crispy and the salsa tasted very fresh.

We also ordered their chips and salsa which we thought were very good.

{"text": "Per the suggestion of a friend, we stopped at Cinco for dinner on a recent Sunday. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full with only two tables open and several large parties with children. Cinco is very kid friendly. We started our meal with guacamole and salsa. I was a bit taken aback by the fact that you have to pay for chips and salsa. I always feel nickeled and dimed when I have to pay for bread or chips. The guac was extremely bland. It tasted like it onl contained two ingredients, avocado and a ridiculous amount of lime. I had about three bites and left the rest on the table. I then ordered the ciudad due mexico-seasoned pork topped with pineapple, onions, cilantro and salsa with a side of rice and beans. I opted for no onions and somehow ended up without salsa as well. Good thing we had some on the table. I thoroughly enjoyed their tortillas- soft and flaky- but the actual taco was not what I was expecting. The pork and the pineapple were mixed together in the sesoning. The only way I can explain this is that they mixture was prepared earlier in the day or possibly earlier in the week and was warmed up and placed in my tortillas. I understand that slow roasting takes time and am fully on board with the meat being prepared ahead of time. However, I felt that adding the pineapple to the mixture masked the taste of the pineapple. As I was biting the tao, I was unsure if the chunks I was gnawing on were of pork or pineapple. They both tasted the same. This dish could have been much better had they added the pinpple on top of the meat prior to serving. All in all, I do not think that I will head back to Cinco.", "user_id": "f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA", "business_id": "PZAQwvTRnVtqbaC8tZMx6w", "stars": 3}

I agree with some of the reviews that this place looks more like a bar than a fancy restaurant due to the central bar, and that the seating is not \"intimate,\" but overall I thought it was a nice family-type venue.  Our waitress, Nikki, was friendly and efficient, with an excellent knowledge of the menu items.  Since everything is made to order, she suggested various ways to customize our meals, too, which was greatly appreciated by my very picky dining companion.  Nikki checked back with us frequently, refilled drinks and chips without having to be asked, and went out of her way to see to it that we enjoyed our meal.  The homemade chips and salsa we ordered were very good, not like the pre-packaged kind you get for free at most Mexican restaurants, and well worth the additional small cost, especially since they were refilled.  The menu is diverse, leaning toward Mexican cuisine instead of tourist food, the chef obviously well-versed in various regional foods and quite adept at producing unusual and flavorful combinations.  Even the refried beans were exceptionally good.  Our meals were artfully plated, the food of excellent quality, came quickly, and the portion sizes were large.  The prices are appropriate for the amount and quality of the food.  There were so many fascinating, unusual choices on the menu that I can't wait for another visit to try out additional entrees. Overall, Cinco was a very pleasant dining experience that I would recommend to anyone.

They had a \"soft opening\" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.\n\nBut it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is FANTASTIC.  My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  It was gigantic. I got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being AMAZING.  I was surprised when I opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  We also shared an order of chips and salsa.  Both are homemade.  Seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  I think not.  Heaven.  Their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  I liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.\n\nRight now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  However, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so I think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.\n\nI am so, so excited to welcome El Burro to the neighborhood!

El Burro is every bit a taco stand!!!\n\nYou can't miss: the Chorizo Street Style Tacos, the TJ Dog, the Carnitas Gringo Style Tacos and the housemade chips, mild salsa and guacamole.\n\nThey don't currently offer horchata but I was assured its coming in the future.

{"text": "Thank God - actual street tacos here in Pittsburgh!  A friend caught this place on Yelp and got me and an officemate here for lunch.  What a great find.\n\nI have been longing for street tacos since a couple of trips to Cancun and then finding a taco stand in Michigan of all places that did an amazing job with them.  Here, they are about $2.50 each and a choice of shredded beef, carne asada, shredded chicken, potato and chorizo.  I think I may have missed an option or two but they are perfect.\n\nJust the right amount of meat, on two freshly made corn tortillas with a delicious pico de gallo and two hot sauces on the side with a slice of lime - you are set.  \n\nI got 3 street tacos (shredded beef, carne asade and shredded chicken) and a fountain drink for a little under $10.  Just the right amount of food and it was fast.\n\nThere are just a handful of seats and a lunch counter that runs all along the wall.  If you expect to eat in, get there before noon like we did.  Otherwise, not sure how the tacos will make the trip back to your home or office.\n\nThe others with me went with the burrito of shredded chicken and the extra $1 for guacamole.  They enjoyed their selection but both were a little disappointed with the light spread of guac on their burrito.  Other than that, this place was a crowdpleaser!\n\nMaybe I'll branch out and try some of the other offerings.

{"text": "I'd like to make my deep love for El Burro known. I would write love letters to these incredible tacos if I wasn't fearful of spilling salsa on them. What a fantastic neighborhood find, thanks again to Yelp!\nLots of vegetarian choices and variations of those choices. The potato tacos are mouth watering, with flaky flour tortillas, fresh veggies, and chunks of potatoes cooked in some magical spice that makes me crave them nightly. The rolled potato tacos are a surprisingly huge portion of 4 taquito type goodies with loads of cheese and fresh pico. There are tons of different burrito options, I think 11 in all, many vegetarian or having veggie friendly possibilities. Oh, and some have french fries, which makes my inner fat kid squeal with delight and feel naughty at the same time. I adore that they have vegan chorizo and the breakfast burrito is definitely worth tasting, even though those potato tacos are difficult to pass up! \nEl Burro has the best salsa I've ever tasted. I guess this is controversial since other reviewers seem to find it too thin or even runny. I don't care about chunks, apparently, just flavor. And this stuff has it! Perfect amount of kick to compliment those homemade chips. The guacamole is good, although they don't give you much of it on the side. They carry Mexican Coke (sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup) and other south of the border bottled beverages which only adds to the El Burro vibe and experience.\nThis is primarily a take out joint, although I suppose you could eat there if you wanted. There just isn't much seating, just a handful of stools at a couple counters. Order at the counter or call ahead. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. And it's cheap! $2.95 per taco, $5-$6 for rolled tacos, $6.95 for burritos, $2.95 for chips and a huge container of salsa. \nI'm so delighted to have El Burro as my new neighbor.

Rich and filling enough to share. \n\nThe chicken soft tacos are consistently good, with slow-cooked white and dark meat and a thick green sauce. Topped with onions and cilantro, the only thing that makes them better is a squeeze from the lime wedge that comes alongside.\n\nFinally, the chips and salsa steal the show, in my opinion. Chips are actual deep-fried flour tortillas (presumably their leftovers) with just the right amount of salt. They're flakey and oily and oh so good. The salsa is thin (which I love) and bright and fresh tasting - a good counterpoint to the richness of the chip.\n\nHighly recommended.

Not bad just sort of funky. I was super excited that they had Jarritos. yum.\n\nMy friend accidentally ordered a burrito with pico in it and when she realized she asked them, politely, if they could keep it off. Well it was already made and she was very apologetic but still asked if they could make another one. Obviously this sucks for them and they weren't rude about it but they did keep trying to get her to take the one with pico. I know it's a pain to have to remake something, I do get that, but it just started to get kind of weird. The kept saying, \"Are you sure you don't like pico? when was the last time you had it?

It's a silly line to type, I know, but for my most recent meal I just ordered one burrito that was about $6 or $7, and it was massive - as big as and maybe bigger than a Chipotle burrito. I didn't even eat dinner that day, I was still so full from lunch!\n\nI'd ordered the shredded beef burrito and I really liked it; the rice had been mixed in with vegetables that had been marinated in a mildly flavored sauce, so it had the teeniest of spicy kicks. I'm not a big spice person but I thought it was reasonable and mild enough that I still enjoyed it. My only complaint is that whoever made the burrito did not evenly distribute the meat. I bit into one corner and thought, \"Wow, I have a ton of shredded beef on this thing!\" And I was in heaven - that tangy beef mixing with the slightly spicy rice and veggies? Awesome! Alas, 3/4 to the end of the burrito, the meat trail ended, and I only found a few wisps of beef at the very end. It was still delicious eating the rice and veggies, but I would've loved to have a more even distribution of meat in that burrito since the beef was easily the best part of the whole ensemble. \n\nStill, good food = I'm not going to gripe too much!

You could tell they were homemade. The default salsa was AMAZING, perfectly spicy, and you get a pretty big container of it. The guacamole kind of irked me. I don't know if it had too much lime and was sitting around for a few days, or not enough spice, or a combination of the three, but something was off about the flavor, and it tasted too limey. I'll have to give it another shot next time and hopefully I just got part of an off batch.\nI then moved onto refried beans and some rice. The refried beans with queso blanco were just right. The rice was really bothersome. It was bland and had a green bean in it. Green beans do not belong in Mexican rice, which makes me suspect that the rice came from a frozen rice mix or something.\nAnd now for the stars of the show...\nThe potato taco (street style). Holy shizz, this thing was absolutely mouthwatering! I am pretty sure that I am going to start having dreams about this taco. I also got a vegan soyrizo street taco, which was perfectly spicy and smoky. And as if I didn't already have enough food, I also got a shredded chicken street taco.

Upon further inspection and subsequent eating I found the meat, but not very much. And to boot - it tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. Very bland. All that weight of the burrito? Pretty much all white rice with a couple of corn kernels and peas and TWO cilantro leaves.... And it all tasted like... well, nothing! I had to drown it in my hot sauce here at home.

They could have really perked this place up with a sit-in area- however, obviously the space is small and carry-out is pretty much the only way to go here. I have to say the food was good, but as other people have said the quality is not much of a step-up compared to the Taco Bell down the road. I got a rice and beans burrito, which was almost 6 bucks. The fact that even lettuce and tomato are extra ad-ons is ridiculous. I don't think I've ever seen that in any comparable food chain/restaurant. As other people have said as well, the people behind the counter were not very friendly.

{"text": "I stopped by with CM this past Sat. around 5pm after a visit to the Mattress Factory for a quick snack.  We were a bit hungry, but weren't necessarily up for a full dinner. I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and saw that El Burro was an establishment nearby that I'd bookmarked, and CM said he was up for Mexican. Thus, we decided to brave the quasi-sketchiness of this end of Federal St. to check it out.  \n\nThe first thing that immediately became apparent upon walking in was that there were no tables--only a handful of counter seats on either side.  Between that and observing other customers, it's pretty clear that most of El Burro's business is take out.  Undaunted, we decided to get a few tacos and settle in to eat them at the counter.  CM and I both ordered two chicken tacos in hard shells ($3.75 each), and I also got a bottle of Tamarind El Jarritos soda ($2.29).  The tacos were served about 5 min. after ordering.  Unfortunately, though they had appropriate textural variation, I found them bland in flavor.  The skimpy portion of red salsa served on the side, while hot, added little flavor to them.  No guac or sour cream was included, which was disappointing--apparently, you have to pay extra for it. \n\nUnfortunately, I feel that El Burro epitomizes what's wrong with the Mexican food scene in PGH--Mexican food is supposed to be bold and flavorful, not bland!  Between the blandness of the tacos and the price that we paid (over $16), it just wasn't worth it.  In retrospect, after looking at the photos, we would have been better off ordering two flying saucers instead of the tacos.  If you're looking for delicious, inexpensive tacos, I recommend Edgar's in the Strip or Las Palmas in Oakland.

I ordered a little bit of everything, which included two orders of chips and salsa and five orders of guacamole. They did not send the chips/salsa or guac, or plates, silverware, napkins etc. Since the meeting was in the area, I called them and spoke with the manager and I explained that part of my order was missing. He said he'd deliver it within about 1/2 hour. \n\nAbout an hour and a half later nothing. I called again. The manager asked me if he could just give me a credit. I said no, I prefer the food to be delivered as promised. Then he asked me what time they close. That shouldn't matter considering the food should all have been there 2 hours ago. Then he begrudgingly agreed to deliver it. \n\nI don't know about you, but I understand it was a simple mistake, which would have normally been fine. The problem was the attitude and lack of follow through. Not to mention this was a pretty large-sized order. If this is the service they give to a customer who spends a lot, I can't imagine the service you'd get for 2. \n\nNo thank you El Burro.

{"text": "I'm from Southern California and my boyfriend lived in San Diego for a couple decades, so it's safe to say we have some pretty strong opinions on Mexican food. But my boyfriend actually grew up in Pittsburgh, so we make somewhat regular visits to see his family. Over the summer we were with his brother and needed lunch on the North Side. His brother took us to this place without really telling us anything about it. Imagine our surprise when we walked in and saw a menu plucked directly out of San Diego. It's all there: California burrito, carne asada fries, rolled tacos (the latter would be called taquitos nearly anywhere else). They even had a TJ hot dog on the menu--which is not necessarily a taco shop staple, but you'd see it at food stands in Tijuana and some SD shops had started incorporating it. And it's not just the menu items that were making us homesick--even the lettering was in true San Diego fashion.\n\nOn my first visit, I just ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which is comfort food to me. I basically hold it on par with grilled cheese sandwiches in terms of simple pleasures. And the burrito was pretty nice. It is weirdly difficult to find a decent bean and cheese burrito at a taco shop in Louisville. On that visit Matt got a couple of street tacos and a TJ hot dog. They were solid as well.\n\nOn our more recent visit Matt ordered carne asada fries. I asked for potato rolled tacos but they were out, and I wasn't feeling the other rolled taco options so I ordered a carnitas street taco, a carne asada street taco, and a shredded beef hard shell taco. The street tacos were nice. Good quality tortilla (corn, obvs), cilantro, onion. The carnitas wasn't the best ever but it was solid. I didn't like the carne asada though. It was a weird texture? And it kind of tasted like seasoning more than meat. Matt's fries were still amazing despite the mediocre meat. I pretty much only ever ordered carne asada fries while intoxicated but these were tasty sober. The carne asada just wasn't good enough to stand alone in a taco, but it worked with all the goodies on the fries. My hard shell taco was ordered on a whim; I hardly ever get hard shell tacos but I knew this place would make their own shells. It wasn't the greasy perfection for which I had hoped--I like a shell that is fried moments before consumption and still oily, which I guess is super bad for you so maybe it's better that's not what they do here. Anyway, I'm not going to fault them for that, because you really shouldn't order a hard taco at this place anyway.\n\nOverall, although the carne asada itself was disappointing, the novelty of getting carne asada fries in Pittsburgh is enjoyable enough that this place gets a solid four stars from me. I also like that they have vegetarian and vegan items on the menu.", "user_id": "ueWEF2HBFeWDjKnzM2U7dw", "business_id": "lqvE9OXtOdtbB_m55U5kGg", "stars": 4}

One time the beans are super and the next time they have no seasoning at all.  More often then not the beans are in the bottom and everything else is in the top. Their Carne is of poor quality with a lot of gristle. The chile relleno tonight was not lightly battered and deep fried like usual. There was a big gloppy  mess of  batter in the bottom of my burrito not even attached to the pepper which was of course in the top of the burrito. \nI had to return while my whole family was eating at home to get my money back and the cook felt he could justify why I was sent home with a really poor quality burrito instead of just apologizing and saying that the issue would be corrected in the future.", "user_id": "BnbjZUwlTl0cQeJH20qDoA", "business_id": "lqvE9OXtOdtbB_m55U5kGg", "stars": 2}

Whether you order a taco, tostada, burrito or quesadilla, you can order it with the different meat combos that they serve.  I ordered 3 soft corn tacos.

Julie ordered a quesadilla with beef in mole sauce and a tostada with jamaican jerk chicken.  \n\nEach taco I ate was spiecier than the last.  I usually like spicy; but this was over the top for me.  My taco with pulled pork had an avocado cream sauce and pineapple mixed in.  The pineapple was the best part because it gave some sweetness to the spicy pork.  The shrimp diablo had me hiccuping, which means I had gone too far with the spicy.  The poblano chili and potato had thin strips of fresh poblano chilis and a cream sauce on top.  Notwithstanding how spicy the tacos were, they were flavorful.

Fresh cilantro, mangoes, and onions kept each of my tacos bright and really tasty!\n\nDessert - I wasn't going to have any, but my waitress talked me into the truffles, which were amazing.  Chocolate truffle with whipped cream in a phyllo cup with a piece of dried kiwi to garnish.  Small, beautiful, with a surprise chili inside for a bit of kick to wrap up the meal.  Very nice!\n\nOnly con:  no alcohol (BYOB only), and I would have enjoyed a nice margarita with such a tasty meal.", "user_id": "Pqyi8LjQYPvHekXySdCGAA", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 5}
{"text": "Am I missing something?\n\nGiven the excellent reviews I dined here with great expectations.  The tacos were so lack luster I thought--the chef is having an off night.  I came back the very next night to try this place again and it was WORSE!\n\nI'm sorry, I SO wanted to like this please because I.LOVE.TACOS.  Who does not love tacos?  How can a taco possibly go wrong?  I just don't know what happened.\n\nThe tortillas are made in house, but they taste like they were deep fried and are mushy.  I had the carnitas tacos and they were completely bland.  Everything needs salt, which honestly is kind of refreshing considering most restaurants over salt every thing.  This taco was basically wet soft meat in a mushy tortilla.  Queso fresco and some ripe tomatos could have saved this taco but neither was an option.  You get meat, in a soggy tortilla, with onions on it.  There are home made salsas available but both only added heat. not flavor.\n\nThe next night I came back and tried the fajitas.  You get a pile of gristly meat over pungent red peppers.  No cheese, no guacamole, no anything but meat and peppers to put in your soggy tortilla.\n\nI am confused by all the great reviews.  This place is right next to Davio's and the entire time I was dining here I kept thinking how much better my meal would be if I were having dinner at Davio.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, but the food...  I honestly am so confused by the good reviews.  I really want to like this place.  The food is AWFUL.\n\nTwo stars for the friendly staff.", "user_id": "hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 2}
{"text": "Our experience here was SO BAD that we were convinced it was part of some social experiment to determine:\n\n1) How long people would wait for their food,\n2) How bad the food would have to be, and\n3) How ridiculous the portions/prices would have to be\n\nfor the guests to get up and leave.\n\nOur party of 10 arrived shortly after 8pm and was seated outside on the sidewalk. We brought our own beers and ordered a couple of baskets of yuca chips with guacamole. Our chips arrived within a couple of minutes, but with salsa instead of guacamole. When our server came back we asked about the guacamole and were told they were out. We then ordered two servings of jamaican jerk wings and tried to order another two baskets of chips but were told they were out of chips as well. We then tried to order the avocado fries and were told they were out of those too.\n\nOur server came out with the wings in a couple of minutes. We ordered an additional two baskets of wings, three orders of the queso fundido, and our entrees. This was around 8:15pm.\n\nONE HOUR LATER we still had not received any of our food and it had been about 30 minutes since we'd seen our server. I went inside and politely asked the bartender if she could check on our order because it had been about an hour and we hadn't received our appetizers or entrees. She replied, \"We make all of our food fresh so it takes longer than a chain restaurant. When you come here, there's always a bit of a wait for food.\" Um, ok?\n\nAbout ten minutes later (approximately 9:20pm) our server came outside and explained that there were still two tickets ahead of us and our appetizers had not been started yet. We asked if our entrees had been started, because if they hadn't we would've just paid for the two orders of chips and wings and left. We were starving and freezing. She said yes, the entrees had already been started, so we stayed. \n\nAround 9:30pm our server came back with the two additional orders of wings, as well as two baskets of chips for us to munch on. (We thought they were out??) She explained that because of the wait, they would waive the $0.50 \"corkage fee\" for the bottles of beer. How nice - you're comping us something that it costs you literally NOTHING to do.\n\nA few minutes after that she returned with the three orders of queso fundido. The vegetarians in our party were so hungry that we scarfed the pickled mango salsa that came with the wings. We were told repeatedly by our main server (as well as an additional helper) that there's always a wait for food because they make everything fresh. Only ONCE did someone apologize for the wait.\n\nAt 9:52pm, ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES after we'd ordered, our entrees finally arrived. I'd ordered the \"Chiles Relle\u00f1os.\" As described on the menu, they are \"Cheese filled poblano peppers drizzled with a walnut and goat cheese cream sauce, garnished with pomegranate seeds.\" This entree costs $10. What I actually got was ONE pepper (not pepperS) in a small bowl. No sides. I asked the server if it was only supposed to be one pepper and she said yes. Then why is it called ChileS Relle\u00f1oS and described as pepperS?!? As my friend remarked, \"$10 for a pepper?! That's not even California prices!\"\n\nTwo people ordered the $15 Jamaican Jerk Tofu, \"served with mango, plantains and coconut rice.\" There were no plantains and the tofu was extremely salty. It tasted like it had been marinated in spicy soy sauce.\n\nWe finished our food within 10 minutes and our plates were quickly cleared. Three couples asked for separate checks and the remaining four people were put on a fourth check. Our server asked us how we wanted to divide all the appetizers, including the four orders of chips. Wait a minute - we only ordered TWO basket of chips!! When we'd tried to order a second set of baskets, we were told they were out and that's why we ordered the queso fundido. We were under the impression that the second set of baskets was complimentary because of the wait. Eventually our server agreed to waive the charges for the second set of baskets.\n\nTWENTY MINUTES LATER she came back with our checks. Except that they weren't itemized. Each check listed ONE item in the order, and then a total cost. And the total didn't add up to the sum of the items plus tax, it was up to a few dollars more. We asked if the discrepancy was a gratuity and she said no, that they don't include gratuity on checks. She assured us multiple times that even though the checks weren't itemized, they added up to the correct totals. An order of chips ($3), jamaican jerk wings ($6), three tacos ($9) and chiles relle\u00f1os ($10) cannot sum to $30.50 including a $1.75 tax. Eventually the owner was involved, and after checking on it explained that the discrepancy was a gratuity. Really? A $0.75 gratuity? Okay...\n\nIt was 10:34pm when we finished paying and left.\n\nIf the food is so fresh it takes 2 hours to serve, put a note on the menu or warn large parties when they arrive!

{"text": "Without reading much of the previous reviews, we had an evening planned at the Turkish Cultural Center for a free Turkish film, and did a general scan for something interesting to eat in the neighborhood, and Casa Rasta caught our attention. I did glance through the reviews, and saw that there was quite a mixed bag, but we thought oh well, what the heck, let's decide for ourselves.\n\nMexarribean? \n\nSo the plan was to meet at 5:00 pm, and two of us got there just a few minutes before, still waiting on the third. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly Woody Allen-ish boy in a tie-dye t-shirt, who seated us just inside.  We checked out the menu, which look quite intriguingly enticing, and our server came over to take a drink order, and possibly encourage an appetizer.\n\nNow I see several reviews whining about bad service, and I have to say, I guess this was our lucky day...because the stunning young gal that took care of us was incredibly friendly and helpful. She was pretty, polished, helpful, well spoken, and FAR from the usual grunting yinzer, or angst ridden art school student. \n\nWhile waiting for our third to arrive, we ordered Yuca chips and guacamole, a Diet Coke (Yay, more Coke people) and a Ginger Beer. My friend had the ginger beer, and insisted that I try it, and I had to agree with him that it started out with a medicinal kind of blast, followed by a somewhat intense burning in the back of the throat. I stuck to my Diet Coke. Then suddenly Woody Allen shouted out my name from the bar, and said that our other friend was running behind, but would be there shortly. \n\nWe waited for the Yuca chips, and the server came over and said that she was very sorry it was taking so long, but that they were actually in the process of starting them all from complete scratch, fresh, even to the extent of shaving the Yuca into chips as we spoke. \n\nOur friend actually arrived just moments before the Yuca chips, and they were TOTALLY worth the wait. Sliced VERY thin and perfectly fried, and the guacamole would only have been fresher had they made it tableside. Very flavorful guac as well, not just thrown together. \n\nSo now it was time to place the order for the meal. David ordered a roasted pork quesadilla, Donald ordered a shrimp fajita, and I ordered a steak burrito. And shortly after we'd practically licked the guacamole bowl clean, the entrees arrived. \n\nDonald's eyes rolled back in his head after the first bite of shrimp, which were very nice size, and coated with the perfect amount of seasoning. He proclaimed them delish.  David moaned in delight on the first bite of the pork quesadilla, and again insisted that I try a nibble of the pork. I have to say, it was worth the moan, and a few extras. Beautiful seasoned, with a hint of coconut, good cheese, and TONS of flavor in the juicy pork. Not the usual dried out pork. This was excellent.\n\nThe steak in my burrito was juicy and nicely seasoned, and the burrito was a good meal size. My only complaint was that it didn't come topped with any kind of sauce, but our lovely server brought a couple of different bowls of salsa, one red and one green, freshly made, that I drizzled into the burrito as I munched it down to the nub. I would have liked a little more fire in my spice, but I completely understand where I am. So many Pittsburgher's cry when they simply SEE a bottle of hot sauce...put in a scotch bonnet? Not on their life. (and NO, it's NOT a hat!) So most foods here that would normally be a challenge to a spice loving tongue have been pandered down to please the pierogi tongues. \n\nAfter dinner, David opted for dessert, and was won over by the description of the home made hazelnut cheesecake, that the server told us the owner made herself. She described it as more like a mousse than a cheesecake, and she was right. It was spectabulous! My only suggestion to them on the dessert would be: COME ON! If you're going to make something THAT from-scratch scrumptious, put away that can of spray whipped cream! It's so easy to make shipped cream from scratch, and my goodness did that cake deserve that extra touch!\n\nThe place developed a very pleasant little crowd in the hour we were there, the server was always present and friendly, keeping the water and soda filled, and the dishes cleared, in addition to making genuinely helpful suggestions.\n\nThe bill for all that we ate only came to around $44, so this was really a very worthy stab in the dark new restaurant try. If we end up in that neck of the woods for another event at the Turkish Cultural Center, which I'm sure we will, Casa Rasta will be the first place we check into for dinner.\n\nVERY pleasant experience indeed.", "user_id": "tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 4}

It would have been really great if it wasn't doused in a pound of salt.  You had to literally wipe the salt off the yucca chips.

I had originally placed an order for the shrimp a la Diabla taco but we were told they ran out of shrimp.  I asked for a recommendation from the waiter and he mentioned that if I liked spicy food I should go with the Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco.  However after receiving both the chicken and beef taco - the beef definitely packed some heat while the Jamaican Jerk wasn't as sizzling as he suggested. \n\nAlso the chicken did not look like chicken, it looked like beef but didn't have a strong beef flavor so I was utterly confused by what I was putting in to my mouth trying to discern the mystery meat.  They may have used dark chicken meat or it was saturated in some colored flavoring that made it unidentifiable to the naked eye and unsophisticated palette.

{"text": "I don't like giving low star reviews but i'm sorry my experience here was very poor. The two stars are for the food but i would give five for the environment and decorations.\n\nWhen we first came in it was pretty crowded even for a wednesday night at 7:30. They had 2 or 3 open tables but they were too close to other people so we sat at the bar. There was no sign saying please wait to be seated or seat yourself and it appeared that the host was also the waiter and maybe even the cook. Once we sat at the bar a woman greeted us and provided us with menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked for a margarita and she said \"do you have tequila.\" i didn't understand the question seeing that this was a bar and tequila is what is served in a margarita. Then she says that they don't have a liquor license but if i had brought my own they could prepare one for me. I was completely caught off guard especially since they have bar glasses that hang above their drink station and a whole rack of what are now empty wine bottles. Very misleading..BYOB is cool but don't have a bar look exactly like a bar then tell me you don't serve alcohol, what a rip! They even had one of those rubber drink mats that said Patron tequila on it so what the hell?? \n\nAny who, I asked for a virgin margarita that she said she could make and of course after 30 minutes she must have forgot because it never arrived at the table. I decided to just go with a water and one of the bottled mexican sodas, Jarritos. We ordered the avocado fries which was $8 so I assumed we would receive plenty. When the plate arrived it was a measly 6 slices of avocado with salsa evenly placed around a plate on a bed of lettuce. (see photo) I was like WTH is this. $8 for these little slices, It had to be only half of an actual avocado and the fact that i was splitting it with my sister made it even worse. After the app we looked over the menu which appeared to have alot of good choices. I chose the potato flautas and my sister order the curry goat.\n\nEach meal came with rice and beans, for mine it was mexican rice and hers was coconut rice. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally did boy did it look dry! The rice on both our plates was not moist at all and looked like it had been sitting wayyyy too long on the plate. My dish said it came with sour cream and lettuce which were both missing. I asked for the cream but she didn't even notice that the lettuce was missing. Before she brought my food she told me that they had run out of potato flautas so i said chicken was ok. Expecting chicken in my meal i bit into it and discovered that it was potato. I find it strange that you don't know what dish your serving your customers. The flautas were premade not in the store but probably from a box and they tossed large pieces of shredded cheese on top of the flautas which only partially melted so it just peeled off like dried elmers glue. Thy shell was way to thick and there was almost no potato inside. The beans were flavorless like they came straight out of the can and were just heated. The rice was ok but it also tasted like it came out of a box and had been sitting wayyyy too long. \n\nMy sisters meal was nothing to rave about either. She ordered the curry goat which once it came to her table was very dry with no curry on it whatsoever. When you think of curry you think of a thai place that makes it like a sauce for your rice. I've had plenty of caribbean food and this curry was not what real curry was supposed to be. they should have said curry flavored instead of curry goat. When she asked for more  sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and then returned saying that the curry is prepared with the dish so that there was no extra sauce on the side. WHAT??? How do you not have extra curry when it is essentially a sauce. I mean really people, it was like pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. (see pic) Her rice was dry and flavorless as well. Coconut rice is supposed to be sweet and a lil saucy but this stuff was like steamed white rice you get at a chinese spot. The only thing we ended up enjoying was the guacamole because it was very thick, creamy and had a little spice to it. Other than that all the rest of the food wasn't even worth my taste buds time.\n\nMy hubby came late and ordered a burrito with marinated pork. they brought out the burrito but with no sauce. He opened it up to see what was inside and it was 90 percent rice and beans and a few spoons of pork shreds. It tasted alot better than our meal but the fact that it came out dry AGAIN just left me shaking my head. After we finished our meal I was ready to pay and go. Unfortunately my hubby was talked in to ordering dessert. I protested but he couldn't resist. he ordered the churros and my sis got one of their truffles. The churros looked great when they came out but they were overcooked. the truffles were nothing to rave about either. \n\nEverything was DRY DRY DRY..I won't be going back!", "user_id": "E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 2}

{"text": "I didn't have high hopes for this place considering it's location, but if there's a vegan taco to be had, I'm going to try it. I had some sort of seitan taco and a veggie burrito combo. The taco was boring, served with just seitan, no vegetable to dress it up. The flavors were OK, but I've had way more exciting tacos. The burrito was big. That's about all you could say about it. It had stuff in it, but nothing very interesting. I was super hungry, so it was satisfying enough. The server will ask you if you want chips and salsa, say yes. It's $3 and the green is pretty good. Red was meh. The food aside, the wait staff seemed to have some serious issues. Everyone that worked there seemed to have been hired that afternoon. It was chaotic and an unnecessary amount of people were on the (tiny, tiny) dining room floor all at once. The girl \"in charge\" seemed to be about an inch away from a full blown panic attack, and there were only 6 tables. It was a bit stressful to watch.\n\nJust a warning - If you find reggae music just as unbearable as I do, be prepared. You will hear it here, obviously. I think this place has potential. They need to tweak some menu items, hire a competent waitstaff and purchase furniture that is more than 5 inches off the ground (seriously it feels like you are on the floor). Basically, if this place was another restaurant completely, it would be good. \n\nIt's BYOB though! And cheap!

I don't know--but it's there: And it is Casa Rasta.\n\n$3 tacos, $5 appetizers, $10 entrees.  Easily, they could charge 3x as much for each of these delicious plates.  But they don't need to.  They don't even have a liquor license (it's BYOB), and they don't need that either.  What they have is: Great food & an identity.\n\nThe identity is the love of culture that is inside each bite of pork, chicken, beef, spicy shrimp, beautiful bean dip, or avocado fries (yes, that's breaded and deep fried avocado slices w/ delicious tomato-onion dip).  Sometimes the food is a little more Caribbean, sometimes it's a little more Mexican, and sometimes it is in exact harmony - depending on what you order.  \n\nBut whatever you order -- whether you ala carte it and try multiple tacos, tostados, burritos, and apps... or do a full entr\u00e9e (still only $15 max) and cap the evening with one of their unbelievably delicious and aesthetically-pleasing desserts, you will know you are part of something special that is honoring you, the food, and the concept and practice of culture in every bite.\n\nAnd you can come back the next day and afford to get some more, because they -- unlike many of Pittsburgh's new foodie venues -- are concentrating on your food experience, not your wallet.", "user_id": "AVQbj72MxzR7UBDYiBHBOw", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 5}

We did not make reservations so we decided to eat outside rather than at the bar (which is now used for seating only as they are BYOB).

The creaminess of fried avocado was not a pleasant texture for me though, others at the table liked it. For my entree, I got the flautas. Spicy chicken and onions wrapped in crispy corn shells topped with more guac and onions. The meal came with a side if rice and beans. Overall, I enjoyed the meal.

{"text": "I stopped by here this past Friday with my fiance, another couple and their toddler.  My fiance and I arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 PM and walked in to see a mostly empty space.  Shortly thereafter the hostess came over to us and asked us if we had reservations.  Sadly I thought that the place was a little bigger than the maybe 5 or 6 tables that it had in it and we did not.  We were then offered the option of either sitting inside at the bar or outside.  Since we were going to have a toddler with us, we ended up choosing outside even though it was threatening to rain.  Due to us sitting outside I didn't really get to see how the dining room looked.  The bar I did get to see though and whenever you were in there it almost felt like you were in a tourist trap in Mexico.  There was some cheesy 70's overstuffed red chairs and a lot of Mexican tchotchke behind the bar.\n \nSoon after we chose to sit outside the other couple made it there and had brought their own bottle of wine since Casa Rasta is BYOB.  Upon coming over to introduce herself the waitress ended up taking the bottle of wine off of the table and disappeared into the restaurant.  I don't think I have ever seen a BYOB bottle of wine disappear into the restaurant before but it ultimately didn't matter as it was returned about 5 minutes later.  At this point the other couple ended up ordering a quesadilla for their toddler and the waitress left us.  A number of minutes later she arrived back with the quesadilla and we were able to order.  The table started out by sharing an order of guacamole and also the fried avocado fries.  For my entree I was having a hard time deciding between the chicken curry and the fish tacos but my mind was made up whenever my fiance ordered the fish tacos and I noticed a little fire symbol next to the curry naming it as very spicy.  The guacamole came out first and ended up tasting rather good.  It had a slight spice at the end that gave it more depth than your normal guacamole and tasted good on what seemed to me to be homemade tortilla chips.  Whenever we had finished with the guacamole the avocado fries came out with a Isleno sauce ( it seemed like a tropical marina?).  Even though the fries didn't have too much flavor to them I ended up enjoying the textural components of as the outside was crunchy while the avocado inside was soft.  Dipping them into the Isleno sauce helped to get them some extra flavor as well although it wasn't the best combination I have ever had.  Next up were our entrees and my Jamaican jerk curry came with coconut rice and pickled onions.  Wow, what a let down it was as my entree was very bland.  I literally could not detect even the tiniest bit of heat in my Jamaican jerk curry.  I guess my idea of Jamaican Jerk and Casa Rasta's is quite different as mine normally involves scotch bonnets or haberneros.  The pickled onions also seemed to lack the bite of being properly pickled which is a shame as I loved pickled vegetables.  Other than being bland my meal ended up being ok as everything was cooked nicely.  The curry sauce on the chicken kept it moist and it went well with the coconut rice.  My fiance was also nice enough to give me one of her fish tacos and after eating that I knew that I had chosen poorly on my entree as the beer battered fish was good.  As our table was coming close to finishing our meals the weather took a turn for the worse and we ended up heading inside to finish off our meals at the bar.  By this time there was only one empty table in the restaurant.  We eventually made it out of there but not before quite a bit of a wait for our checks and then again while paying them.  As a matter of a fact the service the whole night was pretty slow and blas\u00e9.  It seemed to take entirely too long to get our meals ordered and the food to come out in addition to the fact that my water glass was empty from before we finished our appetizers to the end of the meal.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back to Casa Rasta in the future.  While the service was not very good the food had some potential but I would love to see my dish have some heat especially it is marked as very spicy.", "user_id": "kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA", "business_id": "lzoHy4zrJ_avbJGO5HMOUQ", "stars": 3}

I picked this restaurant as we were staying close in Greentree and wanted something good, but close and fairly fast.  Based on all the prior great reviews, I chose Casa Rasta. \n\nFirst, it is a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables and a bar.  We had no reservations and there was not a table for the 4 of us.  We sat at the bar, at least the bar stools were comfy, because we were there for almost 2 hours.  \n\nWe ordered spicy black bean dip and some salsa.  Our salsa came out quickly and then 30 minutes later our black bean dip arrived.  The dip was delicious.  It had great flavor although the chips tasted stale.  \n\nWe then WAITED FOR 1 MORE HOUR AFTER COMPLETING OUR APPETIZERS FOR OUR MAIN COURSE.  We had two salads, a quesadilla, 4 steak tacos and 3 fish tacos with a side of black beans.  I could have gone to the store and made something better in less time.  Besides the salad, which was delicious, everything else was not appetizing at all.  The steak tacos were this weird breaded steak without ANY flavor, luke warm and just bad. The fish tacos were not a crisp fried breading as you were lead to believe.  Rather they tasted as they had been sitting out or someone put them in the microwave. \n\nMaybe if we had only waited 20 minutes for this mediocre food, I wouldn't be giving this such a poor rating.  However, the service was horrendous too!  Our waitress said when asked about the long wait, \"yeah, there are lots of orders.\" with a sorry, too bad attitude.

He really liked his $10 carnitas torta but my beef tacos ($4 each) looked and tasted like the meat had been sitting out on the counter all day long. Dry and unappetizing, to say the least. My husband may have liked his sandwich, but the meat had the same problem, dried out to the point of being crunchy on the edge (unintentional crunchiness for this dish). My tacos looked so lonely and naked sitting on the plate all curled up at the edges with hardly any condiments on them. I did add the complementary red and green salsas which helped enormously. At Mad Mex you get three tacos and beans and rice for $12-14 and they are so much better. We were there on a Saturday night and it was busy, so I don't understand dried out and tired food. Our server looked like he came straight from performing in High School Musical. The whole place seemed to run by high schoolers. He was nice but so awkward I thought he was performing from a script.

{"text": "We moved to Beechview back in April and Casa Rasta was the restaurant we visited to celebrate when we got the keys to our new house. Our first visit there was amazing. So jaw-droppingly amazing that we have tried to go back to redeem all of our bad experiences and we keep leaving severely disappointed. While we hope the service and the food will improve, we are skeptical and have decided to take our support of local businesses elsewhere (particularly to El Milagro, on the other side of Beechview).\n\nOur past 5 visits we went they have been out of at least 2 items -- ironically, it would seem, they are always the items that I want to order. So disappointment #1.\n\nSince just prior to the opening of their East Liberty location, service has gone down the tubes. We often know more about the food than the servers, and we never have a visit to Casa Rasta last less than an hour -- even when our selections are easy, like tacos and burritos. It often takes at least 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then it often takes 30-40 minutes for our food to get out, even when the place is empty. When it's packed, be ready for a 2-hour visit. So, disappointment #2.\n\nAdditionally, the past handful of visits, at least one person in our party's food has been not just lukewarm, but cold. That being said, you feel like it's hardly worth complaining about because even when you send in complaints via email, you never get a response, and if you mention it there in the restaurant, you'd be waiting another 30 minutes just to get hot food when you've already likely waited for 45 minutes.

Instead of focusing on my negative opinions about Mexican food in the burgh, I'll focus on the positive at Reyna's.\n\nFirst, some history; I actually took a small tour of this place about 4 years ago when it was barebones (but still looked functional) and have been wondering why the long wait.\n\nWell, upon entering, you'll see why. The atmosphere is extremely solid and beautiful. Very intimate as well. But, we're here for the food right? Reyna's is one of the handful of Mexican groceries in the city, and they have a reputation for making salsa and their chips are everywhere! I think Mad Mex still buys their tortilla chips..though that may have changed. Regardless, they had a lot at stake here and the time to prepare.\n\nThe payoff is great...and give it some time..

Really nice, and I wish more Pittsburgh venues were visually impressive like this.\n\nOur service was friendly and reasonably attentive, though there were only 3 tables seated at the time we ate, around 6pm on a Sunday.\n\nNow the rest:\nI love Mexican food, from the authentic (as in, I ate it in Mexico) to the street food scene (LA taco carts, Reyna's taco cart, the place on Atwood in Oakland), to the homestyle mexican restaurants (like El Campesino)\n\nI also especially liked Reyna's drinks - lime agua fresca and horchata.\n\nSo I was very hopeful that Reyna's really good taco cart beginnings would translate into an even better restaurant experience.\n\nBoy were we disappointed.\n\nFirst off, they never offered any complimentary chips and salsa, even after we ordered entrees... so if they do then I missed out.\n\nMy daughter, who loves the lengua served at the local taco carts (Reyna's included) ordered the two lengua tacos.  They would not mix it up (meaning one fish, one lengua), you had to pick only one.\n\nI ordered the dish with four moles, because I really like any mole i've ever had.\n\nHer tacos were quite good, though she liked the Oakland taco cart ones better.  I think the reason why is that they were under-seasoned.\n\nMy moles were especially disappointing.  One (with chicken) - i think mole ranchero - was too sweet, and not richly flavored, didn't like it at all (and that's my favorite!).  Two others were good but not great.. the best was the green with pork, though the pork was chewy.  And the one with I think ancho and poblano was deeply earthy but not enjoyable, though the meat in it  was tender and good.\n\nNot a bit of cilantro or lime with my food. Both my rice (white) and hers (red) were bland.\n\nOur appetizer of the roasted corn and cheese (Esquites?) was also very bland. The chips needed salt as did the corn stuff... very very wet, as if there was a lot of cream in it... it was not at all what I hoped for, but I don't have other experiences with that to compare.\n\nFinally, the horchata was unusually creamy and more gritty than usual (for Reynas). My lime agua fresca tasted like sugar water with barely a hint of lime. When I told the waiter, he came back with a pitcher of intensely strong lime stuff with barely any sweetness at all, very sour. I just added a bunch of water and sugar to make it better.\n\nSo all that for $40... meh, we won't be back, unless we hear excellent news sometime in the future.", "user_id": "om6ejl21mqLuXBtVLfjgdA", "business_id": "rB6IWv6mW2IVjvgfvNGdHg", "stars": 2}

As I understand it, the idea behind Casa Reyna is to serve more food from other parts of Mexico (that aren't close to the US border), and maybe that's so. However, I found that the food here just wasn't that... interesting. I mean, everything tasted perfectly ok, but it seemed to lack any real flavor. The chips and salsa were the one exception: as good as everyone says they are. But the rest of it, I found to be really kind of lacking. The ceviche had these tiny, tiny shrimp that just absolutely had no taste to them, for example. I don't get it; serve me some actual crustaceans and charge me more. The entrees were similarly bland; I had a fish entree and my girlfriend had a sort of pasta-like thing, which was the only thing that actually seemed to have some interesting sauce on it.

A good, traditional mole sauce has more ingredients than my attention span can handle and the fake stuff that comes out of a jar (or that is served at any of Pittsburgh's other \"Mexican\" restaurants) just doesn't make the cut.  Imagine my excitement when I got to Casa Reyna and saw that the menu not only includes a traditional chicken mole, but a total of FOUR different moles all wrapped up into one beautiful sampler dish.  I wish I remembered what they all were, I know in addition to the chicken there was a mole verde with tomatillos and poblanos served with the most succulent pork ever, a beef with some kind of red mole, and a fourth that really could have been made of anything (I really have no idea) but I do know I would eat spoonfuls of it.\n\nIn addition to my obsession with this sauce, I loved everything about Casa Reyna.

{"text": "This might have become my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, but it's not perfect.  Since it's under Reyna's grocer it's in a basement, and it's tough to get away from that feeling.  It's not that you feel claustrophobic in there, but no windows are no windows, and it has a bit of that basement feel to it.  The decor/ambiance (aside from no windows) is nice and warm, although the decor is fairly (putting it nicely?) over the top.  \n\nThe salsa and chips are fantastic, but ask your server about the salsas.  I'm a bit (also putting it nicely) of a wuss when it comes to spicy food.  So I've ordered salsas that were a bit over my threshold, and I regretted it.  The sweet mango salsa is fantastic, but skip the guacamole.  I love some guacamole, and can make better at home.  It just doesn't really taste like anything.  \n\nMargaritas - If you balk at the $12 price tag don't be fooled.  You essentially get at least 2 when they bring you a shaker,  so be prepared to drink up.  \n\nIn my two visits I've tried the enchiladas verde, and the tacos (steak, chicken, and chorizo).

{"text": "The restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating to our large group, but I found the food to be very mediocre for a Mexican restaurant. When I asked the waiter for some hot salsa to literally spice up my very plain vegetarian quesadilla (cheese, spinach, and mushrooms in a bleached white flour tortilla), I was given two small bottles of hot sauce, rather than a small cup of fresh salsa or fresh jalapenos. This was very disappointing to me. I expect fresh salsa when I ask for some salsa in a Mexican restaurant. I can buy hot sauce to use at home. I want FRESH ingredients when I'm at a restaurant. \n\nWhen I tried both bottles, and they still weren't very hot, I asked if there was anything else I could add to my food because, I explained, \"I like hot and spicy food.\" Then, he brought me two more bottles of hot sauce, and a very small container of a green salsa. It was OK, but the flavor was nothing special. The bottles of hot sauce were also just OK. (Although, one bottle of hot sauce WAS highly entertaining for its name, \"One Fucking Drop at a Time!\" Seriously. I'll post pics when I have time. That was really funny!)\n\nThe quesadilla was edible, but nothing special, and nothing that I would go out of my way to eat again. There really wasn't any seasoning or spices used. It tasted very plain, which is why I wanted some hot salsa. Maybe their meat dishes are better, but I've become a vegetarian and haven't eaten meat since Jan. 1, 2014. There were very few options for vegetarian meals.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the guacamole, which was very good on my plate, but not so much on my head! One of the waiters (while clearing the table) had overloaded a tray with plates and accidentally dropped one of the plates with leftover food RIGHT ON MY HEAD! \n\nI felt the plate (and food) land on me from behind, and then it fell over my shoulder, onto my lap, and onto the floor! I ended up with guacamole in my hair! I wish someone had recorded a video of the dish falling on my head because I'm sure it would be hilarious to watch, and I missed my opportunity to become a YouTube sensation! LOL. Fortunately, I sustained no damage, and I'll bet my hair will be extra shiny this week due to the guacamole conditioning treatment that I received at no extra charge. \n\nI would go back to Casa Reyna if I was with a group that wanted to go, but I would not seek it out myself. The selection is kind of slim pickings for vegetarians. But, the staff is very nice. I have no bad feelings about the dropped plate. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. I was a waitress in college, and my nickname was \"Crash!\" LOL. But, I never dropped food on anyone's head. I just dropped a tray full of glasses on the floor once at C.J.

{"text": "\"Nacho Typical Mexican Joint!\"\n\nI've been around my share of the many variations of folding, wrapping, frying, rolling, and re-arranging of rice, beans, cheese, salsas and meat in the many, many varied but 'the same' Mexican restaurants, from Texas to da burgh. From the now deceased Chi-Chi's, Taco Bell, Border Stop on the low end of the tortilla scale, to the Happy Taco in St. Louis, and the many variations of El Campesinos and Patron Grilles in da burgh. Fajitas, Burritos and tacos...oh my.\n\nI was pretty much expecting an overpriced version of the same (I know how jacked up Reyna's prices are in the store upstairs, having lived in Miami and Puerto Rico, and know what that stuff USUALLY costs - plus we ALL know what the Strip has been trying to turn into) but I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst off, they have turned a basement in a very comfortable and charming eatery. I was amazed at how great a job they did with renovating. It's comfortable without being pretentious, spacious even when crowded, The tables are not bistroid tables that require a balancing act if you order more than just two dishes, and the decor is kitchy without being Chi-Chi's tacky.\n\nNow, I do have to preface the food description with the fact that everything IS on the pricey side...but that being said...\n\nThe offerings are NOT your usual Tex Mex offerings. You will recognize a few things on the menu if you're a fan of the usual Mexican food, like Fajitas, Nachos...but there are very few of those recognizable items, and in my book, that was awesome.\n\nWe started with an appetizer dip. The Elote (ay-LOW-tay) which was a delicious dish of grilled sweet corn blended with mayo, cheese, cilantro and a little red pepper, served up with the Reyna chips. New to me, unique and yummy. \n\nMy friend did order the chicken fajitas, but even they did not arrive looking like your usual fare. The fajita 'stuffing' was in a hollowed out fresh pineapple, and was served on a plate with two bowls, one of rice, and one of refried beans. My friend took a bite of the beans and her eyes opened wide...and she said 'You HAVE to taste these beans!'  So I did...and was pretty amazed. They had a savory sweetness to them that almost made them kind of like a gravy frosting. I've never tasted anything quite like them.\n\nI decided to try one of the unfamiliars, and tried the cuatro moles (kwahhhh-tro MOW-lays). Chicken in a cocoa mole sauce, pork in a tomatilla (toe-ma-TEA-yah) mole, beef in a kind of barbecue mole, and chicken in a type of ancho mole. Served up with a side of spanish rice.  The pork was by far the best, moist and flavorful, with the chicken in cocoa mole coming in neck and neck with the beef barbecue. The other chicken wasn't so good, probably all breast (and I have NEVER been a breast man), and on the very dry side. I could eat the pork mole as an entree alone, over a bed of lightly seasoned white rice. Jummy-jummy.\n\nI really loved that I got to try 'out of the ordinary' Mexican dishes for this area, AND that they were presented nicely, and made very well. Delicioso (Day-LEE-sea-OH-so). \n\nOur server was an adorable guy named Manolo, who was incredibly gracious, meticulous and purposeful. My friend commented on how every move he made seemed 'intended'. He was helpful, attentive, refilled our beverages quickly, and was nice to chat with in Spanish, which made my friend say 'I have no idea what you're saying'.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving the full five stars is the pricing. It really is a little steep. Nothing on the menu in the dinner category really fell anywhere under $15, and the beverages were definitely on high mark-up. Two Diet pepsis and two iced teas...$3 EACH. That's $12 for regular ol' non-alcoholic drinks, only $2 cheaper than the cheapest entree. I maybe could have lived with $3 refillables...but $3 EACH? That's a bit outlandish. But then Reyna tends to gouge wherever he can. I'm surprised the water was free.\n\nI do have to say, even without eating the dry chicken mole, I was QUITE full, and very satisfied, as was my friend. She even had to take a photo of her Fajita presentation...swearing that she 'never does that'. I would actually return just to try something else I've never had before. There were plenty of those on the menu.\n\nYou did a great job there Reyna...just ease up on the gouging...leave that up to the Sunseri and Wholey families. They've mastered the art.

{"text": "I came here with several friends a couple of months ago.  I convinced them to give it a try, since my labmate and the reviews seemed to indicate that it's the most genuine (sit down) Mexican restaurant in the city.  Given PGH's paucity of good Mexican options, I was excited to try it out!  The space was plenty large enough for our group, and we were seated without any wait, etc. on a Sat. evening at 6pm.\n\nWe started off with some margaritas.  Two of my friends opted for the mango variety, and I chose the strawberry one, which I split with another friend.  They were both delicious!  Per other reviewers' recommendations, we split the salsa sampler with green and sweet mango salsas.  This comes with a batch of their chips, made fresh in-house.  While I expected to like the mango salsa best, I found that I actually preferred the green salsa, as the mango was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If possible, I'd recommend trying several salsa varieties to see which you like best, as tastes vary!\n\nNext, we ordered entrees.  After much deliberation, I chose the mole enchiladas, which came with refried beans and rice.  While the enchiladas themselves were good, I wasn't a huge fan of the mole sauce--it was a bit too bitter for my taste.  The food was definitely quite filling, however, to the extent that I was unable to finish it.  If/when I return, I will order something different--perhaps the chiles rellenos, which my labmate recommends.  One of my friends, who grew up in Honduras and Peru, ordered the fajitas.  Holy Toledo, talk about a lot of food!  Although he has a decent appetite, he ended up taking half of it home for later consumption.  We definitely concur that the food is very genuine, so don't come here expecting Tex-Mex.\n\nService was generally okay, but I have one complaint.  When we ordered the margaritas, the waiter carded us, which is understandable given the laws and that all of us are in our twenties.  We arrived at different times, and he carded two of my female friends when they sat down, saying he had to be fair, etc.  However, he did not card my male friend, who arrived last, despite that he was not the oldest in the group.

The Habanero packed some serious heat & after burn so I had to dip lightly on that one. Hubby dove in with abandon because he loves the heat and most often can't get anything hot enough. This was totally to his liking. The green jalape\u00f1o wasn't overly hot but had delightful flavor. We'd love to go back and try the Chipoltle and the Spicy Mango, too. \n\nThe mini tacos are a great deal at 4 for $9 with the option of choosing 2 varieties. I chose the braised pork and El Pastor with crispy pork and pineapple. Yum on both with serious high praise for the El Pastor. Hubby tried the pork and Tinga, which was a chicken taco with lots of great flavor. \n\nThe restaurant is really cute with a nice rustic style located downstairs off Penn Avenue with some communal and smaller tables plus a small bar.

They were quickly prepared, and brought to my table. I also grabbed all three salsa options, and put them on the side. They were all used quickly! The El Pastor was probably my fav, it reminded me of tacos in Cancun on Spring Break, oh so many years ago! But the Barbacoa was good too, nice and flavorful. Chicken is chicken, but still, so amazing. \n\nCan't beat the deal, or the punch of flavor!

{"text": "3rd time, last time.  Not going to get into the food mess that resulted in the gift certificate from visit two, but with much reluctance, we returned.  It was a nice night so we opted for the outdoor table.  (I think this could be a no-no if you want good service because I don't recall getting this neglected indoors) 20 minutes after the seating, we were finally approached and ordered chips and 2 salsas, queso fundito and shrimp ceviche to share.  After traveling to the other three tables first, the chips arrived accompanied by 2/3rds empty standard white ramekins.  Very runny salsa...  Nearly impossible to dip.  Flavors were ok though! Still I have no freaking clue why they don't just serve the oh so delicious table salsa that they sell in the store. A round bowl would also be nice. Nevertheless, all would be forgiven if they brought their A-game with the cheese dip.... but it never came.  Instead, after traveling to the other 3 tables first, our shrimp in ketchup, errr, shrimp ceviche arrived.  Tiny boiled shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro stirred into about 2 cups of Mr. Heinz special sauce, topped, or shall I say, shielded by a half an avocado. It was literally disgusting. All you could taste was fishy ketchup, and I looove ketchup. (see picture) When I finally got the waitress' attention, before I could request my bill and a vomit bag she realized our queso was not on the table and split.  Moments later we were handed a heaping bowl of the thickest queso I've ever had.  Not necessarily the worst.  The flavor profile and splash of salsa verde were interesting, but the heft of the dairy and thickness were too much.  3rd trip to Casa Reyna and 3rd extreme variation on the classic staple.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough.\n\nI had so much hope for this restaurant.  Reyna Food's is such a strong established store, how could this happen?  Pittsburgh desperately needs good Mexican, and all we got here was substandard food at a PREMIUM price.\n\nI should note, that on previous occasions I have had the tacos.

It was everything good about Latin vegetarian food, with lots of flavor, not just a mess of bland beans and cheese.The corn salad was great, there was a charred flavor to it. I was very excited about the pickled cactus salad and wasn't disappointed. It was mixed with some peppers and onions that were also pickled, and was pretty spicy.

There's no windows down there but it feels like you're in something straight from Mexico City. Loved the atmosphere. \n\nI learned that they make all of their tortilla shells and chips fresh right there in the restaurant, hence all of the smells.  All of their margaritas are made fresh as well with fruit juices and agave nectar. Try the guava margarita if it's on special! A-MAZ-ING. \n\nThe menu itself is pretty big with a lot of selections. I recommend trying the salsa sampler for as low as $3! Try at least the mango one. Nice and sweet.  \n\nEven though the menu gives you a wide selection, I'd say the prices are slightly higher than normal. Maybe because it's an authentic Spanish restaurant but who knows. I went with the steak tacos topped with onions and fresh cilantro with a side of black beans... I had to choose between beans OR rice... not both... which is not favorable in my opinion. I'm a hungry man! I need both. \n\nIf you're looking for an authentic Spanish restaurant with a great atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place in the Strip District.

We were greeted immediately by a very friendly person upon walking in the door.  It is a small, well lit and clean restaurant with interesting artwork on the walls.  The menu is even more interesting with a range of authentic Mexican dishes.  We began with the guacamole and chips and agreed this wonderfully chunky guacamole was amazing, and we promptly are it up. Everything looked exciting on the menu, so it being my first of many visits, we ordered the sampler to share.  When the plate arrived, it was a beautiful set of sights, smell and tastes!

Then we both ordered from the churrasco section and were blow away. I got tbone with rice and sweet potato fries. The tbone was seasoned pretty darn good and cooked to order and I never knew sweet potato fries could be so amazing from a Mexican place. The chicken seasoning made my boyfriend surrender to deliciousness, he put his fork down and said \"im done. This is too good\". Ended it all with a nice coffee. Not one complaint!

They were really accommodating with seating requests and such.  \n\nThe restaurant is BYOB and they offered to chill the white wine we brought while we waited.  \n\nI thought the food was rather good, especially for Mexican in Pittsburgh.  I think this is the closest thing we have to \"real\" Mexican food within Pittsburgh city limits, especially due to the demise of Mexico City (health code violations = death).  The chips were good - they reminded me of the style they serve at Las Velas, but seemed fresher and tasted better than those at Las Velas.  The guacamole tasted very good, although I didn't really think about it much at the time.\n\nI ordered enchiladas which were marketed as being able to be served with chicken or beef, but the waiter told me I could have any meat listed at the bottom of the menu (this included chorizo, I believe seafood options, et al.). I chose pulled pork.  I thought the pulled pork enchiladas were very well done.  The pulled pork itself was moist and marinated well.  The corn tortillas (you can choose corn or flour for all dishes - this is great for me, who tries to avoid gluten) seemed really fresh.  I've been a lot of places where the corn tortillas fall apart easily, or where they are stale.  I was really happy with my meal as a whole.\n\nAnother plus is that they will run your credit card at your table with the ipad, and you can choose your tip portion by percentage.

{"text": "I stopped by here this last Thursday evening with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to a completely packed restaurant with no tables available.  Thankfully our friends were already there and had grabbed the last table for all of us.  La Palapa isn't a terribly large place and I would guess that it can seat about 30 people or so in the dining room.  This means that it can get very loud in there especially whenever there are larger groups at some of the tables as there was on this Thursday. It is decorated with photos on the walls from what I imagine to be Mexico.\n\nOur group decided to start off the night by splitting both the chips and queso as well as the chips and guacamole for our appetizers.  The chips seemed to be freshly made but were pretty oily and seemed to lack some seasoning.  They were crunchy though and tasted good in both of the dips, each of which was creamy and delicious in its own way.   For my entree I decided on the enchiladas nortenas which consisted of 3 chicken enchiladas in a red sauce, a 6 oz steak and then the rice and pinto beans that comes with each entree.  I also ended up ordering a barbacoa quesadilla as a side dish to my meal.  All of the parts of my entree were decent with my favorite parts being the steak and the quesadilla.  While the steak seemed to have only been cooked on one side (pink until half on one side, well done on the other), it was thin enough that it still tasted good and I liked that it seemed to have the texture of the skirt steak.  What I liked about the quesadilla was the perfectly crispy shell and the flavor of the meat.  At $3.50, this may have been the best value of the evening for me.  Last but not least, even though we were all stuffed from having eaten our meals, our table decided to finish our meal by splitting a sopapilla.  While it wasn't like the sopapillas that I have had in Arizona, it was still good and seemed like a mash-up of churros and strawberry ice cream done right.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

{"text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time! I finally got in there yesterday night and I'm already itching to go back.  It was a Sunday around 7:30 and the place was about half full. My friend and I were both first-timers, so we decided to sample a few appetizers together. We shared a pineapple tamal with the green sauce that was delicious. In retrospect I think I would have liked something with cheese better (bean and cheese/ spinach and cheese were two options of the day that I wished I had gone with), but the green sauce with the tamal was fantastic. I can't wait to try their different varieties in the future. At $4.95, I expect I'll order the tamal appetizer every time I come here. \n\nWe also shared the chile relleno appetizer, which was good but not too exciting. We got it with half green half mole sauce to try both. Their mole sauce is delicious and has a lot of depth of flavor, but the peppers themselves were underwhelming and there wasn't enough cheese for my taste. We still ate all. of it. I also got a mushroom taco, which sounds a bit strange but was actually delicious. My friend got the barbacoa taco and loved it. $3.25 is a great price for tacos. \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the chips and salsa. I'm finally over the fact that you can't get complimentary chips and salsa at any Mexican place in the city limits (unlike most places I have been to outside the city), but when I pay for an item that many places are giving away for free, I expect to get a decent portion. Although it's only about $3, the portion of salsa they give you is really disappointing. It's a tiny little bowl that I think should actually qualify as more of a ramekin. No big deal overall though, just a lesson learned. Pictures on here seem to indicate that cheese and guac come in more appropriately sized bowls. I guess it's just the salsa. \n\nOverall I loved it and I can't wait to go back and try something else.

Everything is brighter, the space feels a lot more open and welcoming. Our waiter was with us immediately, gave us menus, and quickly went down the list of drinks.

{"text": "La Palapa is the quintessential example of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant: a hole-in-the-wall with great food.  I visited last Sat. with a couple of friends after seeing a movie at the South Side Works cinema.  I tried a sample of the tamales at the Yelp Burgh Bash, and since then, had been wanting to try this place out, so the movie afforded a great opportunity for a visit.\n\nBetween three of us, we ordered the platter (\"charola\") para dos and an a la carte entree order of tamales.  The platter comes with the following items: taco, quesadilla, empanada, tamale, flauta, chicken, and ribs, plus rice and veggies.  In addition, I believe we were given an extra quesadilla.  We ordered a variety of different meats, including chicken, pork, and chorizo, as well as beans/peppers for the fillings.  Because there were so many different items, it's hard for me to remember the details, but most of them were very well-executed and delicious, with the standout being the tamales.  The only items we found lacking a bit were the taco (the chorizo's flavor was a bit off) and the empanada, whose filling I found a bit too liquidy, and my one friend found a bit too piquant.\n\nOne minor disappointment was that they were out of agua fresca (pineapple that day) and horchata by the time that we visited (around 8pm).  Since we hadn't brought any booze, we ordered Jarritos soda instead (lime for me, and orange and pineapple for my friends), which was good, but likely not as good as the freshly-made bebidas.\n\nThe ambiance in this place is exactly what I look for in a good hole-in-the-wall eatery, complete with interesting and culturally-appropriate decorations, music, and friendly service.  Given the hour at which we visited, the dining room was only 1/3-1/2 full, with one party of somewhat boisterous middle-aged women who'd taken advantage of the BYOB policy to the fullest comprising most of the diners.  Their fun didn't detract from ours, though, since they were pretty well-behaved, although it did make things more interesting--one of them bade us a rather obsequious goodbye on the way out.  We felt that the portions were generous and the prices were inexpensive.\n\nIn sum, if you're hungry for a quality and authentic Mexican meal at a good value in the South Side, check La Palapa out!  4.5 stars.", "user_id": "9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA", "business_id": "qylwlQOVkj-Dwqr5n2Fd9A", "stars": 4}

The atmosphere was nice, everyone talking and enjoying themselves. We brought two fifths of tequila with us and they will supply the pitcher of mix for you. It costs $12 per pitcher, and I believe they charge $3 per person to byob. Still a good deal. The waiter was fast to welcome us and very friendly.\n\nHe brought out salt and limes as well as ice. We ordered the guac and chips, the queso, a chile rellano, and I asked if they had a bean dip which they did not. The guac was delish! The chips were def homemade and a little greasy, but still crispy and tasty. The queso was watery, the flavor was good, but the cheese just dripped off of the chip. I prob wouldn't order the queso again. They tried to accommodate us with a \"bean dip,\" but it was more like they poured some beans on a plate and served them. They weren't good. I appreciate them trying, but for $5, I'll pass next time. The chile rellano was FABULOUS.\n\nI ordered the enchiladas with the mole sauce. The mole sauce was the best I've ever had. Flat out delicious. I ordered two mushroom and one cheese enchiladas. The mushroom enchilada was on point, very very good. My meal came with a side of veggies and rice. Both tasty.

{"text": "Who would've thought that delicious authentic Mexican food could be found in a tiny little hole-in-the-wall joint in the Southside?\n\nI've been wanting to go to this place since seeing some of the reviews on Yelp (thanks Yelpers!), and it did not disappoint. As mentioned, this is a hole-in-the-wall, but in the best possible way -- cute, cozy, unpretentious, and not dirty or outdated. It only has like 7 or 8 small tables, but it was not at all busy when our group of 4 went on a Sunday evening. We were the only non-Spanish-speaking customers in there at the time, which I was hoping was a good sign with regards to the food's authenticity. \n\nTheir menu is smaller than some of the other typical Mexican places around the 'Burgh that have, for example, 17 pages of Combos #1-100 to choose from. I think this is a good thing, because it means that they can focus on a few dishes and do them well. La Palapa's menu covers most of the Mexican basics -- tacos, tortas, tamales, quesadillas, flautas, burritos, enchiladas, etc., along with churrasco meats. Note that unlike at most other Mexican restaurants, you will not get free chips and salsa to start here. Maybe that speaks even more to the restaurant's authenticity...do they serve free chips and salsa at restaurants in Mexico? I've never been to Mexico, so I have no idea, but free chips and salsa totally sounds like an American thing to me. I digress...\n\nI opted to get the mole poblano con pollo with pinto beans and vegetables (subbed for rice). It was simply delicious. You can tell that this food is fresh, homemade, and prepared with care. The chicken breast was succulent and so tender that it easily fell apart when cut with my fork. The mole sauce was slightly sweet and warmly spiced, although not hot spicy. They do have squeeze bottles of a very hot homemade green sauce (similar to the green sauce served at Chicken Latino) that you can add to your dish to kick up the spice intensity if you wish (which of course I did!)  The pinto beans that came as a side were very flavorful and well-seasoned, as were the vegetables (a mixture of fresh zucchini, squash, carrots and spinach). \n\nMy dining companions each ordered various items (tacos, enchiladas, tamales), and everyone was equally impressed with their food. I had a bite of my husband's poblano tamale and it was to die for. Also, their tacos are enormous! Along with the tamale, my husband got a chorizo taco and immediately had to knife-and-fork it because it was so big. One of our friends got a chicken taco and attempted to eat it the normal way, but had to give up because there was just so much filling. So they definitely don't skimp on the portion sizes here. Delicious food and a good value -- a rare combination these days! \n\nService was fantastic. We had the sweetest server who was very attentive in filling our waters, checking in to see how we liked the food, clearing our dishes, etc. It's also BYOB, which is awesome (although we did not take advantage of this -- next time!)\n\nSeeing as La Palapa shines in service, food, and value, this will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican.

{"text": "I first experienced La Palapa in small quantities at a couple yelp events in Pittsburgh Public Market- I was super excited to check out this adorable little restaurant and try some full size options!\n\nMy sister and I visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00- there were a few parties in the small restaurant, allowing us to have plenty of options on where to sit. We chose a cozy little table next to a window, so we could people watch (who doesn't love that?!). First off, our server was ADORABLE. He was super helpful, in a great mood and just made the experience that much better by his wonderful attitude. \n\nI was curious about the horchata, so he let my sister and I sample it before making up our minds. After trying one sip, I knew I had to order it- it was amazing! Really refreshing. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a beef taco, my sister ordered one chicken and one cheese quesadilla. I was given two tacos- one chicken and one beef. Not a big deal. \n\nThe tacos were HUGE. PACKED with meat and served with guacamole, lettuce and salsa. The chicken was awesome- it was shredded, juicy and full of flavor. The guac was amazing and so was the salsa! Our server asked if we wanted hot sauce, and of course we did. WOW. It was a home made green sauce and full of flavor. It added a really tasty kick to the tacos. My sister loved her quesadillas and loved the hot sauce with them as well. I wasn't so crazy about the beef taco- the meat just was a little flavorless to me and it was almost too much meat. I couldn't finish it at all.\n\nThe horchata went PERFECTLY with the tacos. The creaminess of the horchata really cooled my mouth down, which was awesome. \n\nYou can't beat the prices of this place- the quesadillas and tacos are a little over $3 each.. making them a steal!

I think I had much different expectations about this little spot in SouthSide.  I give 3 stars for the great service and the OK food.\n\nFirst - the location & atmosphere:  It is small and on 19th street. Parking was easy to find and when we walked in Bobby had mentioned it used to be an old Thai place.  The d\u00e9cor wasn't anything fancy- It was small and very casual.  There was a large group of maybe 8-10 people next to us using most of the tables, then maybe two other couples.  We grabbed a seat by the window.  I think this place would be better as a lunch spot rather than a Saturday night BYOB dinner spot.\n\nThe service: We had three people waiting on us. One took our drink orders and opened our wine/brought out the glasses.  A woman was taking our orders and was a server in training and had someone showing her the ropes.  Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. They took good care of us without being overbearing or annoying which I always appreciate.\n\nFinally, the food:  We ordered chips and pico plus guac.  The pico, per our server's suggestion, was very good.  The guac was good but lacked a little flavor (garlic? lime? salt? I don't know).  The chips were fresh and not greasy but they literally broke into a million pieces every time you took a bite! I made a mess of course.  Bobby ordered the seafood stew as his dinner and said he very much enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavors and a lot of different types of seafood.  I ordered their special - the chicken sopes.  The chicken and toppings seemed fresh but pretty bland.  The base was dry and didn't have much flavor.  \n\nI would go back and try this place again and then hopefully update the rating/review.

The chicken was cooked excellently - nice and moist, and he enjoyed his meal, but the taste of the sauce was not to my liking. It is mild and has a chocolate base - if you want it spicy, you need to add hot sauce on the side. I had the bbq pork quesadilla and the Barbacoa steak quesadilla with flour tortillas - both were excellent, although I did like the bbq pork one better - it was tastier because of the sauce. Both quesadillas were served with a small side of guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. We wanted to try their hot chocolate, but were too full!

The guac was the only disappointing thing here because it wasn't fresh- it is that Sysco type stuff, mixed with sour cream and heavy garlic.  It's not bad... but it's not good either.  It certainly wasn't worth the $6 I paid for the large bowl to dip our chips into.  That was the only 'low-light' of our meal.  We left with a 'to-go' box stuffed with 'stuff', a couple wrap shells and stomachs full of mexican...  \n\nNext time you're in SS- skip the franchise and give this place a try.  \n\nOur first time here we ordered the Big Fiesta Sampler and the Super Nachos.  Both were heaping and very satisfying.  \n\nHasta la Vista El Toro Loco (Until next time...)  :D", "user_id": "Qs5dcst13DnQJwaBcR4VGg", "business_id": "KiLWYjtTcSL0kc8l3odQlA", "stars": 4}

We decided to sit at the bar and the bartender/server gave us the remote to put the game on. Cool! Obviously we wanted to get right to drinking. I noticed there was probably about ten different drafts available. I decided to get a Blue Moon but figured I'd check first to make sure that BM was included in the deal. It wasn't. Only Bud Light, Coors and YL. Still a decent selection, but if I didn't ask I would have been upset at my bill at the end of the night. The beer itself was okay. It wasn't super cold and they serve it in a glass that's clearly not meant for beer. It's probably big enough to fill just a little more than a regular 12 oz. can of beer. They're $0.99, though. Can't really complain.\n\nThe tacos were decent. They are hard shells (no soft shells with the special) with an average amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheeses. The meat was better than I expected as I thought it was going to taste like fake Taco Bell filler considering they were $0.99. They also filled up our chip basket twice and the salsa is very yummy!\n\nService is so so. The server was away from the bar probably half of the night. The drink specials only last till 9, so my boyfriend was waiting for her to come over to get him a new one. Time kept ticking and she was nowhere to be found.

I am a big fan of Mexican food and this place did not disappoint my palate.\n\nI showed up with a friend after the lunch time rush, which was a good idea because there was no wait for a table or service.  I like the decor inside as it makes it feel like an authentic Mexican restaurant even though it sits in a late 19th century European style building.  Even if the decor wasn't spot on, the food sure lets you know that you are in an authentic Mexican restaurant.\n\nLike a majority of Mexican restaurants chips and salsa are a staple on the table (however, due to allergies I wasn't able to partake in the chips *sad face*).  However, I was able to maneuver around the menu and find something I would not have a problem with.  I ended up opting for the Burritos Azteca.  Now I'm not sure I should say this came out on a plate, it was more like a platter with a small side dish.  Not bad for one meal.\n\nThe Burritos Azteca consists of three burritos: one ground beef, one pulled chicken and one cheese.  All topped with an in-house sauce that has just the right amount of spice.  Accompanying the burritos on the plate is a nice helping each of their fried rice and refried beans.  On the small side dish there is lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  Adding those to the burritos evens out the spice so it's not the most notable aspect of the plate.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I kind of devoured my plate much like an animal.  Things were falling out of the burrito with every bite I took.  I wasn't mad, it just left me with the makings of a little Mexican salad on my plate.  I ate every single bite on my plates.  I wanted more, but I restrained the need to overeat.  \n\nThe service was top notch here too.  Our table was visited frequently to make sure we weren't in need of anything.  \n\nPeople, when you are in Pittsburgh and have a hankering for some Mexican, I implore you to stop in here.

{"text": "My entire experience at El Toro Loco was un desastre (that's Spanish for disaster). I love to eat out, so I have been to a lot of places in my life, and I can say with 100% certainty that as of the date that I am writing this review, this is hands down THE WORST restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of going to. My group was fairly large (8 people), so we expected to wait for a table on Taco Tuesday. Well, we got to the door and there was a sign that said \"No taco Tuesday special today.\" Okay, whatever, that's fine. We still wanted tacos. And margaritas. When it was our turn to sit, we were seated in an alcove behind a wall upstairs. It was kind of weird, but nice to have the privacy in a way. As soon as we sat down, we were brought chips and salsa, which seemed great (the salsa was clearly not freshly made by the way...), but then trouble began. \n\nWith a large group, it is easy to get distracted talking to each other, so finally, it became clear that we had been there for 15 or 20 minutes and no one had come by to take our drink order. We snagged a passing server, and he looked startled and said he'd take our orders. Everyone ordered the house margarita in various sizes  except for one person who ordered a corona, and we got some queso for an appetizer. Ten minutes pass...twenty minutes pass...we ask the server about our drinks and he assures us they will be right out. Tick tock, tick tock...thirty minutes pass. Okay, this was getting ridiculous. After 43 minutes (yes, I timed it), drinks were brought to the table in tiny plastic dixie cups. None of them had salt or a lime, and none of them were more than 8 oz., certainly not 'jumbo'. I looked around at everyone sipping their margarita mix (no alcohol?!) and wondered why I had no drink. The server said it was coming right out. I was getting agitated, so I went downstairs to talk to a manager and was told that she was too busy to speak with me. The margarita I ordered came out 23 minutes after the rest of the drinks and the server brought me the queso at the same time. It was cold and congealed. So, after being at the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half, we had not even had our order taken. We tried to order food and another round of drinks, but they never came. I headed down to the bar to order beers and was told by a bartender to \"hold on like ten minutes\", but was never served. Two girls by the bar told me they were leaving because they hadn't been served at their table or the bar in almost an hour. It was busy, but not busy enough that I couldn't easily walk up to the bar. The bartenders were literally doing nothing. After 2 or so hours, someone else in my party attempted to get a manager to get us our check so we could leave, but we were never allowed to speak to a manager and they never brought us the check. \n\nEl Toro Loco is the most unprofessional business that I have ever patronized and deserves to be shut down for their blatant disrespect for customers.", "user_id": "s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q", "business_id": "KiLWYjtTcSL0kc8l3odQlA", "stars": 1}

{"text": "This review is going to encompass a couple of visits over the years. More specifically the past 2 years of Cinco de Mayo visits. \n\nPatron is a local Mexican chain with 4 locations around Pittsburgh, the newest being the local I will be talking about in East Liberty on the corner of S. Highland and Center Ave.\n\nPIttsburghers never miss a chance to indulge in lecherous behavior and Cinco de Mayo at a Mexican place is no different, even on a Tuesday. My girlfriend and I had made plans to attend Patron yesterday as we had last year right when it opened its doors and pretend to be stereotypical. We made plans for 7pm, which understandably is prime time and we expected a wait, so in anticipation of events I called to add my name to the list ahead of time to cut down on the wait. The hostess must have stepped away as on of the other staff took to the phone [first bad sign]. In broken English I was told of the 1-1.5 hour wait [hence calling 45 minutes early] and I said to add my name to the list. Upon arrival I went to check on where I was in line, just to discover that my name had never been added to anything and that we were back in the queue [1 star for that]. However, we had done this last year also and it was lovely outside so we decided to wait anyways. \n\nIn anticipation of the wait, Patron had set up a front bar where you would be able to have house margaritas or beers while you wait [good redemption]. While we waited we observed the hostess staff where at one point 4 people were standing debating who to seat next. The process was fully manual and groups came and left in droves so crossing outs and addings were happening left and right. We thought this quite inefficient, the same remark we made in 2014. [however that was about a week after their grand opening so we let that slide]. The waiting area, similar to the rest of the restaurant is colorful and ethnic and airy. Very pleasant. After about an hour we were given a booth in the back.\n\nNow the real wait began. For about 7-10 minutes we sat until a busser appeared to bring us salsa and a basket of chips. Our hungry selves immediately delved into these and soon found ourselves thirsting for water. However, no waiter was in sight. After about another 15 minutes rather than a waiter appearing we were greeted by the manager who brought us more chips and salsa and finally flagged down exhausted looking teen so take our beer orders. [Beer works for thirst too but water would have been nice too] Those finally arrived 10 minutes later with surprise! more chips. We observed the neighboring tables who were in similar pain. Nobody to help them along in the process of anything. We kept our eyes out for our frantic waitron who continuously disappeared into a black hole. When we did see him he was frazzled and sweating and busy... with... I actually couldn't tell you. We finally flagged him down to ask for food orders. One side of guac, one Fajita Chesadilla and an Enchilada Carnitas. \n\nFinally. Progress... until the waiter came back and asked if the Enchiladas would be with chicken or beef.... um... carnitas. ... Know you menu. \n\nEventually waters appeared, which was fantastic at that point in time. While waiting for our food, the waitron checked on us apologizing profusely for a backed up kitchen. hm... They sat a table next to us who had eventually just abandoned the process because of no service. [Not the kitchen's fault]. In attempts of cleaning abandoned menu I finally understood how the service was slow. Waitron would do one thing then run back then come out do a single thing and then return to the waitron station... no dear... you made 3 trips for something that could have been 1. This is why you don't hire new meat right before you busy drinking days.... especially when they are 18 and don't know any better. [1 star for this]\n\nTo the actual food. It was good. 0 complaints there. By the end of the evening we had been there for 3 hours for an entire meal. [which was good and still decently warm when it arrived] Even the complimentary shot of tequila was not a good remedy for this. and $25 a person.... i guess that's $8 and hour... [1 star for this]\n\nUnderstandably, we half knew what we were getting ourselves into for the wait outside which is why this doesn't have a single star rating. Also they had a live jazz[ish? band we couldn't figure out what the trumpet player was doing] band playing which was nice, just a little bit [very] loud.\n\nWe will be moving our Cinco de Mayo festivities somewhere else next year.", "user_id": "csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ", "business_id": "SzYlhYIN2i2RDYs2YCrygg", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I haven't ever wanted to come here in the past simply because Mexican food in Pittsburgh has largely been a letdown for me, but I recently went for the Monday night $1 taco/$3 margarita special at the behest of my roommate and it was a decent enough experience. The atmosphere was very open, airy, and colorful. It definitely bordered on the kitschy, but most Mexican restaurants that aren't in California seem to be that way. (The d\u00e9cor reminded my roommate and me of the TexMex places we ate at on a spring break trip a few years back.) The staff was friendly, albeit a little scattered and spread thin. Our server was new, so I can't really comment on him properly. \n\nThe house chips and salsa we started with were free (a huge plus!) and quite delicious. The salsa lacked the complexity of Verde's, but it didn't cost any money so I can't complain too much. Once we ordered the rest of our food it came very quickly. I tried the chicken taco and the margarita. Only the hard shell tacos are $1 on Mondays which honestly should have been advertised since it caused some confusion, but a lot of that could have been due to our green server not explaining the deal to us at all. The taco was delicious and fairly simple...just shredded chicken fried with green and red peppers and onions. It was topped with lettuce, and they also offer cheese if you want. I'd eat it again but only on Mondays for $1. The margarita was clearly made from a mix, so I wouldn't waste my money on it if I ever came back here. (Margaritas aren't that hard to get right!) They have pretty decent beer prices, so I could see myself going that route in the future. Overall Patron is a solid place to get some very cheap tacos during a non-happy hour time of night with lots of available seating, so I give it three stars for that. Better margaritas would have been nice, but for $3 I suppose that's just too good to be true!", "user_id": "y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q", "business_id": "SzYlhYIN2i2RDYs2YCrygg", "stars": 3}

Luckily, they seated us in a secluded corner of the restaurant at long chain of adjacent tables that managed to fit everyone. They are not low on space here.\n+ As people trickled in over the course of maybe 40 minutes, the servers let us take our time to order and were incredibly patient.\n+ Constant supply of chips and salsa is dangerously addictive. We never even needed to ask for more; they would just restock as we finished them. \n+ Food came out in a very reasonable time, with delicious and hearty portions for all. Honestly, after all the chips, my boyfriend and I were able to split a Patron Fajita for one and it was completely satisfying.\n+ Servers were always polite, whether asking how things were or gently nudging in to take plates away. They also brought extra tortillas, extra plates, hot sauce when we asked.\n+ Very accommodating for dietary restriction changes to meals.\n+ They were able to split the check for each person like absolute WIZARDS (even accounting for items like margarita pitchers split 6 ways). That alone is pretty amazing, if you've ever been through the awful math of bill-splitting in huge groups.\n+ Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.\n\nOverall, it's such a fun place, and I personally loved the service and food.

{"text": "We dropped by last week to see what Casa Rasta is all about. Having read tons of rave reviews about their previous location, I was very excited to see that they had moved close-by.\n\nMy wife and I had an unexpected afternoon off, without the kids. I pulled out my phone, and consulted it for lunch suggestions. To my surprise, I saw that Casa Rasta had moved nearby, and we decided to check it out. \n\nWe rolled in for a late lunch and found the place to be quite empty - which was somewhat shocking. How could such a fabled place be empty? I admit we were a little worried... There was only one other table occupied there, but they seemed to be enjoying it, so we stayed.\n\nFrom the time we sat down at our table, to the time our orders were taken, it was at least 15-20 minutes. The waiter was friendly enough, but it just seemed like things were off at the restaurant. Not that I'm always in a hurry, but it would have been nice to get the ball rolling early with some drinks and an appetizer while we looked through the menu. Well, that didn't happen either. When we did get the chips and guacamole, they really did seem like Trader Joe's midlevel stuff. Would have been nice to have warm, salty and thin tortilla chips and guacamole that was freshly made table side, especially since the restaurant isn't too busy.\n\nWe ordered 4 tacos to share. They do offer a broad variety of different flavor options... but... they pretty much all tasted the same. The best ones were the jamaican jerk and conchinita pibil. The seasoning was off, and everything was actually rather bland. The corn tortillas for the soft tacos were decent, and held up well to the fillings.\n\nI guess it's hard to move away from your original spot and end up right next to a tex-mex place across the street.

It had a smokey flavor in the way that your pap's scotch or dog bacon would.. as if they just poured it on. The rice and beans were okay, but no better if I microwaved them myself.\nI don't even remember what +1 ate, so it couldn't have been great.

{"text": "This is good new spot for Mexican or Caribbean influenced foods. The two star reviews aren't warranted, but a little constructive criticism might help. It's true the food can come out a little slow at times and maybe they need to tighten up the kitchen staff to get orders out faster. And I think the reggae music needs to play a little louder in the dining room. It should feel welcoming like an island restaurant and midday when it's low light and low music it can feel a little cold. Other than that, I think the staff is all very nice and the food is great with lots of options - curry, jerk, mole options, chorizo, vegan chorizo, shrimp, chicken, ox tail. If you want your food super fast go get Chipotle, if you want bad Mexican food go to Patron across the street.

{"text": "I had been here once before, and today after walking to Chipotle and seeing a line out the door, I thought I'd venture here again to give it another try, and support a local business.\n\nWell, service both visits is OK. You kind of have to walk all the way into the restaurant to talk to somebody and get seated. While I understand that they're a small operation, I'd kind of expect that somebody gets up and comes to me when I walk in the door, not make me hunt around trying to figure out who to talk to.\n\nThis time, I got 2 tacos - both vegetarian. I do appreciate their decent number of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. One was Soyrizo, and the other was Rajas con Papas (peppers and potatoes). Sadly, the tacos didn't come with much more than that. \n\nThe corn tortillas were great, slightly moist, and warm - and properly doubled up for structural stability like a proper Mexican restaurant would do. The ingredients were cooked just right. But, the mouth-feel and complexity were lacking. Overall, the tacos were quite dry, which I recall being an issue in my previous visit with both dishes we got, and kind of overly simple and limited in ingredients.\n\nI finished one taco, then asked for salsa for the soyrizo to see if it would make a difference. It certainly helped, but I don't think it was the right sauce for the taco. It could use something more - a bit more garlic, a bit more cream, perhaps some cheese (as an option, for non-vegans). I don't want it to be dripping, but I want there to be something to counter-act the dryness and blandness. I want a properly-paired salsa to come on them by default, not as me having to ask for it and picking the wrong type. I want some kick!\n\nI made my suggestions to the server, and I'm making them here as well. I think this place has great potential, and is still way better than Patron across the street.

An hour after ordering, our entrees began to arrive.  We then learned that half of those who order entrees w/beef would not be receiving their order because the restaurant was out of beef.  The chef/owner and an experienced waitress were confrontational and unapologetic for their poor planning and service.  They blame the new, inexperienced waitress for the entire horrid experience.

{"text": "I've been here twice now and seemed to have had a completely different experience each time so I'm going to round it out to 3 starts from what would have been a 4-5 star experience and a 2-3 star experience I'll combine in this one review.\n\nSo the first time I went was soon after they opened and I had the chile rellenos which were AMAZING, and I think the best chile rellenos I have ever had.  The goat cheese and pomegranate seeds were really a fantastic touch.  The service was also excellent and we enjoyed the salsa and cheese dip as appetizers.\n\nThe 2nd time I went was today, several months after my first experience.  I decided to try the tacos this time so I got a beef taco that the menu described came with some type of chili chocolate sauce which sounded intriguing.  I also got the quinoa cilantro plantain soup which sounded really unique.  However, I was disappointed in both.  The beef taco tasted dry and flavorless like it really needed something else, and I couldn't even really taste any of the special chocolate chili sauce I was so excited about.  It felt like it needed some kind of slaw or veggie or cheese or something, as the only garnish I could see was the cilantro (and I guess onion in there somewhere but I could barely taste it).  The quinoa soup was quite bland and uninteresting even though it contained interesting ingredients.  My friend ordered the chorizo verde tacos and it came out as two plain ground beef tacos.  She went to report the error and they tried to argue with her at first then finally admitted that they were out of the chorizo verde!  Ridiculous! They finally brought her regular chorizo which they should've offered the first time.  My other friend with the jerk taco did enjoy it though and that one looked like it had more to it with the mango slices and other accoutrements.  Also, the service this time was just terrible despite the restaurant only having 2 other tables seated at the time.  It took forever for us to place our order, the food took quite awhile to come, and the server never checked on us and we had to find her a couple of times (such as to fix the error).  We also had chips, salsa and guac that were just ok, nothing that tasted super fresh or amazing and the portions were small of the salsa and guac (and the salsa was not free like most places offer). I was definitely disappointed after my first visit.\n\nIt is BYOB so that's kind of disappointing to have no drink options but they said they would make margaritas if you bring the tequila but I think that was limited to a specific day of the week.  It wasn't completely clear.  The decor is really cute with traditional art, very colorful and lively, and a faux thatched roof look along the walls.\n\nI noticed other reviews on here talking about them having an issue with being out of things.  This time they were only out of the pulled pork, but it was a key ingredient of multiple dishes.  One reviewer noted that they were out of so many things because of a busy night the prior night, including key things like guacamole.  If you are a restaurant and you run out of a key app like guacamole, go to the freaking grocery store and buy some more avocados and make some more asap!  Even chipotle does this and that's fast food.  They really need to get it together or they won't last long.", "user_id": "GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg", "business_id": "QUQnWkPauoh6z42X5JQPUw", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Casa Rasta is a great addition to the neighborhood!  And how sad that one earlier reviewer noted he went because there was a line out the door from Chipotle in the shopping center across the street.  Those poor souls are lining up at the wrong place if they are seeking high quality Mexican (and Mexican inspired, Caribbean) food at highly affordable prices.  As a native Californian who has lived in Mexico and tasted lots of Mexican, Tex Mex, Cal Mex food over the years, this is one of those restaurants to cherish because it dares to depart from the tired formulas of so many Mexican restaurants in the US.\n\nMy wife, our adult son, and I shared a marvelous meal at Casa Rasta last night.  We tasted several of the tacos--Beef Birria, (braised in chocolate/chili sauce), Cochinita Pibil, Chorizo, Jerk Chicken.   All were excellent, flavorful and tender,  but the Jerk Chicken was our collective favorite.   Be forewarned, the servings of meat atop the tortillas are quite generous--two of these $4 tacos are plenty for a very satisfying meal.  There are no other included accompaniments as earlier reviewers noted, but you can order rice and black beans, guacamole, chips and tasty red or green salsa, as well as mango,and avocado cream--all for $3 or less.\n\nOur son ordered the curried goat (with Caribbean jerk seasonings) with coconut rice which we all tasted and agreed was marvelous.  I am eager now to try some of the other Caribbean entrees.\n\nThe restaurant is BYOB, and again, where else can you find a corkage fee of $4 for three people sharing a bottle of wine?\n\nService is casual and friendly, perhaps not the polish you would seek in a more formal restaurant, but this is an oasis of the relaxed Caribbean in 25 degree East Liberty!

{"text": "After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to try Casa Rasta. But it's close to my neighborhood and I like to give all new restaurants at least one shot. I'm happy to report that my first experience there was great and I'll be sure to return. \n\nFirst off this place is BYOB, which is always good by me. The corking fee for a bottle of wine is only $4- a nice bonus. When I called to make reservations, the hostess told me that if I were to bring a bottle of liquor, she could make a pitcher margaritas for the table. (Next time!) \n\nWe ordered chips and guacamole, as well as sriracha wings to split as an appetizer. The guacamole was really tasty, a little spicy, but still smith with nice avocado chunks. The wings were equally as good- spicy and not at all soggy. (Soggy wings are a huge turn off, IMO.) \n\nFor dinner, we split plantains, goat curry, jerk chicken, and chicken/potato flautas between the four of us. Everything was delicious. The flautas were so flavorful and the potato mixed with chicken is a nice spin. The goat curry was good, too. It's presented as chucks of meats and rice smothered in a yellow curry sauce.  Next time we go, I'll probably try the chicken curry, just to see how it compares. And in the spirit of saving the best for last... The jerk chicken is really out of this world. There are so many spices and flavors that it tasted like quite the gourmet dish. According to our server, it's also the spiciest dish on the menu. (And I definitely believe that because my sinuses were totally clear after dipping plantains in the jerk sauce!) We didn't try dessert so I can't comment on it. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the meal and I'm definitely coming to recommend Casa to my friends. Best of all, the bill was only $60, which I found a little hard to believe.

I was sick of my leftovers, and wanted something different.\n\nI used to occasionally hit the Qdoba, and although they do tend to be big and flavorful, they also tend to be much bigger in price tag than they need to be. They recently eased up on that by making things that used to be outrageously 'extra' not extra, but a burrito still comes with a hefty price tag.\n\nBea's offers a basic line of Burritos, enchiladas, tacos and quesadillas. They have their own creations, and the basics. \n\nFor my first go, I opted for the basic 'original' burrito. I had a choice of meats, so I chose steak. (Actually, according to the hand written paper on the wall, I had my choice of 'meet'). \n\nIt was about the same size as Qdoba, stuffed with rice, beans, guacamole and steak, a little cheese, and came with a side of some kind of sauce that was tasty, though not too zingy.\n\nAfter I'd placed my order and paid, THEN I noticed another paper sign on the wall for nachos, but since I'd already paid, I decided not to try. They really could work on consolidating their signage a bit. \n\nI got my burrito back to the office and devoured it in about five minutes. \n\nAnd I am torn.\n\nThe price is about the same, now that Qdoba has eased up on their 'extras'. But the flavor, though pretty much probably bioengineered at a chain like Qdoba, IS more flavorful. \n\nBea was a little bland. They could toss in a few more seasonings and I'd be hooked. Kick it up with some true Mexican hot sauces, and I'd definitely be hooked.\n\nBut I suppose my bottom line...support local. Additionally, although I know the holiday spirit nonsense, I wasn't too keen about Qdoba giving a portion of sales to Catholic Charities this past year. That prevented me from going at all. \n\nBea does have seating, and everyone was very nice. The check out gal (Bea?) is a stunning woman reminiscent of early 80's new wave style. Another plus? The kitchen crew actually appears to be...Mexican, or at the very least of some Hispanic extraction. That's a plus.

{"text": "I have a very serious Taco Town addiction. This has become a mandatory stop at least once a week for my work friend Ashley L. and I. This place takes tacos to a whole new level!\n\nPart of the appeal is that the service is extremely quick, and the lady who takes the orders (I swear she never gets a day off!) is pleasant and doesn't miss a beat. It's a good option for workday lunches. Sometimes we take it to go, other times we will eat in the restaurant. It isn't anything fancy, just some tables and chairs, but it gets the job done. The focus should be on the food anyway, right?\n\nMy favorites so far are the chorizo and the carnitas. The chorizo is spicy, but not too much so that it overpowers the other flavors. The carnitas is tender and packed with flavor. Everything is always served piping hot, the onions and tomatoes are fresh, and rice and beans (if you like them) are a great addition to make the tacos a little more filling. They give you an amazing sauce on the side, and are even thoughtful enough to include lime wedges even when you're ordering for take-out.\n\nI say in complete honesty that I could probably eat here every day and not get sick of it. I should mention that the menu goes way beyond tacos, and some day I might try some of the other items... maybe.

{"text": "Cliff's Notes: solid concept, exceptional decor, room for improvement in the kitchen. \n\nThe AMPD Group is at it again! This time, they've opened their 2nd Steel Cactus location in the city. The new spot takes the place of the old Villa bar/club but you'd be hard-pressed to even recognize it! The AMPD Group did an outstanding job with the renovation and decor. When you walk in the front door, you are greeted immediately by a cheery hostess. I came here for lunch and the crowd was much lighter than I expected, however they haven't even been open two weeks yet. I give them credit for opening up this time of year, the crowd may be thin now, but this will be the place to be come spring and summer.  \n\nThe first thing former Villa-ites will notice is the space. The first floor of Steel Cactus seems SO much larger than Villa ever did. There are several high top tables of varying sizes, ample seating at the bar, and large booths, so there's definitely a seating option for parties of all sizes.  They have also redone all of the outer walls with collapsible doors/windows that open right onto the street. \n\nNow, to the food!  As I mentioned, this place just opened up and it seemed obvious to me that maybe the kitchen staff hasn't got their bearings yet. We ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and it was lukewarm with a lot of unmelted chunks of cheese in it. My boyfriend ordered a \"side salad,\" but received a HUGE portion that he ended up taking 3/4 of in a doggie bag.  The salad was delicious though, try it with the mango vinaigrette! \n\nWe also split 3 steak tacos, which were good, but under-seasoned. Also, no sour cream or salsa was served or offered with them.  Another suggestion would be to offer different beans on the side. I would've liked to see refried beans as an option. \n\nOverall, I think this place will find great success here on East Carson Street, it just may take some time for the whole crew to get the machine well-oiled.  I don't live far from this spot at all, so I will definitely be back to give them many, many more chances to improve.

We were seated upstairs and given menus, as the other two people in my party wanted to have a late dinner.\n\nThe waiter came to take our order and my friend was a little too drunk and not paying attention, so I told the waiter her order: a chicken quesadilla.  As soon as she (my friend) heard this, she said \"no no no, it's fine, I don't want food after all.\" So I asked the waiter to cancel that.  Our other party member proceeded to order his food (the 412 Burrito) and then tell the waiter to go ahead with the chicken quesadilla anyway.  I'm not sure what happened, but we ended up with TWO chicken quesadillas and the 412 Burrito.  I wasn't very hungry but figured if they made it, we might as well eat it.  I had one piece of the quesadilla and wasn't terribly impressed. Again, with the black beans, except this time they were inside the quesadilla.  Every time i picked up a piece to eat, the beans came plopping out and onto my plate, the table and the floor.  Also, the cheese was minimal, if not nonexistent... and I don't know about you, but about 75% of the reason I order a quesadilla is for that ooey gooey cheese!\n\nI really, really want to like this place.

While the 2 of us were dancing alone, we noticed that 3 security guards started grouping around behind us and stared at us like we were pieces of meat. This was an easy fix once we all regrouped and they focused their attention on whatever else.\n\nStrike 3: One extremely drunk young woman (I'm talking drunk out of her mind, leaning against the wall, eyes barely open) was being grinded on by a SECURITY GUARD. He obviously knew she was intoxicated beyond  all reason, because while he was grinding on her he was LAUGHING. But wait...it gets worse.  The security guards circled around her while she struggled to dance in the middle and then fell face forward. You would think security would help then...NOPE. They stood there and laughed at her (as did other douchey bargoers, but that's besides the point). Some nice lady and gentleman tried to gently shake her awake (which by the way was the only time someone helped her) when finally ,security, you know, the ones laughing at her, realized \"oh damn, maybe we should help her\"picked her up and escorted her out.\n\nNeedless to say, I am incredibly disappointed in Steel Cactus and the lack of security there is there.

Steel Cactus, I seriously hope your management reads this and reevaluates who you hire.

{"text": "I had no idea that a second Steel Cactus had opened in Pittsburgh until a coworker of mine suggested meeting here with a group last Sunday evening.\n\nI had no problem finding a parking spot on the street (at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon), but if you came at a busier time, you could also park at a public lot just a block away. Like all amp'd group restaurants, the new Steel Cactus is well decorated and has a trendy vibe while still keeping with a Mexican theme. I also enjoyed sitting with a view of Carson Street and people-watching from time to time throughout the meal.\n\nThough this is a fun place to hang out, the food and drinks are just mediocre. I had a sangria (white peach, I believe?) that was tasty but was very sweet and tasted very light on the alcohol content. My margarita was also very sub-par, and one of my coworkers actually sent hers back to be remade. We split chips and three dips, which were very tasty. I do like Steel Cactus's style of queso - mild, smooth, white cheese - and also enjoyed trying a pineapple salsa. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas, which were very light on the chicken and heavy on the saut\u00e9ed/grilled onions and peppers.\n\nThough a little slow, service was descent, especially considering that we were a confusing bunch. We anticipated more people than actually arrived.... Everyone arrived in 10 minute intervals over a half hour period of time.... We had a groupon.... We sent a drink back.... The groupon holder actually had to leave early, before we all paid our checks.... Even with all this randomness, our waiter did a good job keeping up.\n\nOverall, this Steel Cactus would have a lot going for it if they improved their food and drink quality. I would really just plan on returning to order their chips with three dips and maybe a drink.", "user_id": "Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw", "business_id": "p6T_XSO4GRjCehL8FB7W3w", "stars": 3}

In this particular chain, it seems that poor management and poor treatment of their workers leads to the obvious - poor service and quality.\n\nWhen I visited the Steel Cactus location in Southside, they were still fairly new. New staff, new building, new decor. The only positive thing I can comment on is the decor. The drinks were... mediocre at best in comparison to the one in Shadyside, and multiple drinks of mine and my friends' had to be remade, mostly due to the fact that we watched the bartender clumsily make them incorrectly, creating a horrible tasting beverage. \n\nEven worse, the bartender we initially ordered our drinks from was very snippy about how he made the drinks and everything but called us liars when we told him the drinks did not taste as they were supposed to. \n\nAll in all, I could not recommend this restaurant to anyone given their staff, quality, and especially the managers.

We sat at one of the bar tables, my best friend, her husband, my boyfriend, and myself so that they could watch the March Madness game on a Sunday evening. Initially, there was a decent crowd with probably 75% restaurant tables full and 60% of the bar area. Our Server was friendly but that's about it. We ordered 2 dip trios, which comes with salsa, quac, and queso. Queso was cold on both of our plates and we we're only given one basket of chips. We he came back to check on us 10 mins later, we requested that he heat up our existing queso and bring us our 2nd basket of chips. He replied with \"yeah that wasn't my decision\" and walked away... what wasn't your decision? We ordered two appetizers and we need the other half of one of these... and just please microwave our queso please! So anyways, he comes back with new queso......still cold. We complain, he says \"yeah you're actually not the first person to complain about it today\" and leaves again. Just clearly not getting it. We end up getting one new decent queso to split between the four of us. Onto entrees. We waited forever. My friends have been there before, in addition to the Shadyside location. They always get the same thing. My friends salad had been sitting in the window long enough for the cheese to not only melt, but harden into a solid chunk of cheese. Her husband's 412 burrito, which the primary ingredient is steak, came without one spec of meat. My boyfriend was too hungry to care but he said his fajitas weren't great but weren't terrible. My steak nachos were cold and very skimpy. I've had bigger portions from Taco Bell. The manager came over and sent back the burrito and my nachos for remakes. When our meals come out they are still sub par. Only 5 tiny pieces of meat in the $12 burrito and my nachos were edible but with cold queso, yet again, I could barely eat half. The manager, Jake was kind enough to comp our meal which we appreciated because I've never had such a terrible dining experience. He seemed overwhelmed and frustrated with the staff. Ultimately, we were there for almost 3 hours waiting on terrible food. Also, we all felt really sick the next day.

The service here is downright HORRIBLE. Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes while watching lazy entitled waitresses babble incessantly to each other totally ignoring the presence of customers. As we were getting up to leave (which we just should have) the manager came rushing over to take our drink orders and then turned us over to an unpleasant bartender who seemed put upon to wait on us. The drinks themselves were also bad. My girlfriend ordered a whiskey sours which was nothing more than some rot gut whiskey mixed with a neon yellow, straight from the bottle sours mix. Not even topped with a cherry. Truly pathetic. I ordered a draft beer and it was about as bad as a draft can be. There was no head whatsoever and it was about 50 degrees. It was served in a nondescript pint glass with visible water spots. Yum.\n\nThe food itself is also absolutely atrocious. Ordered a chicken nacho appetizer and the chips were stale as if they had been fried days prior and the chicken was bland and laden with gristle. My girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado salad which was a poorly assembled disaster of unmanageable chunks of iceberg lettuce, browning avocados and over cooked, dry chicken with poor excuse for an adobo seasoning on it. I had the carnitas tacos and they were equally terrible. The \"carnitas\" were nothing more than a cheap pulled pork with a sickeningly sweet barbecue sauce on it covered with a cheap yellow white blended cheese. The corn tortillas were also of terrible quality. The rice was not homemade and the beans tasted old and of course straight out of the can. \n\nOverall this place is pretty bad.

{"text": "Before a night at Mario's in Southside, we decided to get together with a group of friends to grab some Mexican fare. With another location in Shadyside, the Southside outpost of Steel Cactus opened up less than a year ago.\n\nPaloma [$8]\nSauza Blue Silver 100% Agave tequila, grapefruit soda \n\nI started off with one of my favorites - the paloma. Unfortunately, either the grapefruit soda was on its last leg of effervescence or it was simply grapefruit juice. That made for one sad drink. I didn't have the heart to send it back because the size of our party kept increasing so we had to move tables three times (completely our fault!). \n\nMexican Mule [$9]\nHornitos reposado tequila, ginger beer, muddled limes \n\nThe GF's tipple was better, with a nice Mexican take on the omnipresent mule. This was subtly sweet, with a bit of herbaceousness and spicy kick from the ginger. Nice. \n\nDip Trio [$11]\nPineapple salsa, queso dip, traditional guacamole\n\nWe started with the dip trio, which featured a choice of salsa (we went with pineapple), guacamole, and queso. The salsa was light, sweet, tomato forward, and had a hint of spice from the jalapeno. The queso was luscious with the essence of Dos Equis Amber added in. The traditional guacamole was light, with the addition of cucumber.\n\nPulled Chicken Tacos [$10.99]\nSpanish rice, beans\n\nThe GF went with the pulled chicken tacos, which were moist and came with your choice of flour or corn tortillas. She went gringo style, which means it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese. Mexican style is the other option, which features cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. The accompanying Spanish rice had some kick. The black beans were tender and came with melted cheese on top.\n\nPork Belly Tacos [$12.75]\nTequila BBQ, spicy red cabbage slaw, radish sticks \n\nMy pork belly tacos weren't up to snuff unfortunately. I enjoyed the tequila glaze which cut through some of the heft of the pork, but the belly was tough and only slightly thicker than thin-sliced bacon. The spicy red cabbage slaw was nice though.\n\nOur server was lovely, but our order was messed up multiple times. It's possible it was a kitchen error and not the server.

Fortunately, staff is always there waiting to help (plate restored!).

Adventurous concept, visually,  and just over-the-top enough to be a talking point, while never interfering with the experience. It's dark, so expect to bring a light for the menu.\n\nThe food was excellent. We had the Al Pastor, Bistec, Tako, and Carnitas tacos. All good, with my only exception being the thick and hard-to-get-through octopus on the Tako taco. Curious if I'll be the only one to make suggestions to the manager on that one. Flavor-wise, it was good. Just texture wasn't ideal. Otherwise, food was spot-on. I'd recommend it all!\n\nAlso started with the Asian Bolognese ask the Papas Bravas. We just returned from Barcelona and Bravas'd our faces off, so I can't say they beat our best there, BUT I'd order again. The bolognese was excellent. \n\nAll-in-all, I'm already looking forward to going back.

The cocktails were the best part--they are all unique and many have mezcal (a smoky tequila, YUM!), which is a rare find in PGH.\n\nWe split chips and salsa, and each got an order of tacos.  I got the baja tacos (tempura fish) and my husband got the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)\n\nWe also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.\n\nI love the decor--nautical meets street art meets gothic cathedral?  It's gorgeous.

Nice view of the open kitchen right out in the street. \n\nMy girlfriend and I each ordered a frozen margarita but the machine was broken. We got some non-frozen variations instead. A grapefruit and sage margarita, which had the right amount of savoriness and bitterness to counter the usual citrus sweetness. My girlfriend's sake margarita was a beautiful fuchsia color and tasted great. \n\nWe split some \"build your own guacamole\" with radish and pepitas. Nice crunch and we loved the tiny sliced chilies dotting the bowl. \n\nWe also split some tacos which come 2 per order. The duck confit tacos, topped with hoisin, chiles, pickled cucumber/cauliflower, mint and cilantro. Each ingredient contributed to a crazy savory/sweet, hot/cool, cooked/raw combination of flavors and textures. The carnitas tacos were our favorite. Tender, juicy braised pork shoulder with crispy bits, avocado, salsa verde, onions, and a crispy strip of chicharron on top. These were packed with juicy flavor. Super rich meat, cut with the acid from the salsa verde. A must order!! The tortillas were nice and chewy, we saw them making them in the kitchen (to order?).\n\nWe split some chocolate mouse cake for dessert after deciding we didn't have room for more tacos (but had room for dessert). It was super rich, and not too sweet, thumbs up.\n\nI kind of wish the tacos came 3 per order (smaller sized tacos) or were smaller but a few dollars cheaper, allowing for more easy sharing.

This place is loud and by loud I mean that I could barely hear the person sitting right across from me. It was also difficult to hear the server and we were practically invading each other's personal space to place drink and food orders. The server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about pretty much every drink. I respect that because not every sever can recommend a drink based from what your likes and dislikes are. I started off with a Ramons gin fizz. Yes Ramons, not Ramos as we expected. It was served in a tiki mug and had a lot of ice in it. The taste was refreshing with hints of citrus and lime. Next, I ordered the aloe and elderflower, which had one large ice cube in it and was oh so tasty with just a touch of sweetness. The only good item that I tried was the queso.

Even the bathroom is cool. \nI found myself at tako two nights in a row, and although I was warned that it would be very crowded, the turnover at the inside bar was fast enough that I only waited maybe ten minutes to get a seat. That's entirely reasonable IMHO. I tried the steak tacos (Bistec) and the grilled chicken/avocado tacos on the two successive nights. I suppose if I was super picky I might have said the beef was a bit too rare for my tastes (they don't ask you about cooking temp), but the flavor was amazing. I actually liked the chicken even better. This place knows how to inject a lot of meaty flavor into their grilled items. This is one thing that makes the tacos truly exceptional.

We showed up around 5:00 on a Tuesday to an already packed house, but were able to somehow score a table outside without a reservation (but you should make one, seriously).  Typical Meat & Potatoes, Butcher & the Rye service:  hoverish without being annoying, super helpful.  We had a slew of staff bring us menus, some fine tap, and had our drink orders taken before I could even look at the \"make your own guacamole\" sheet.  Unfortunately I'm not a guac fan, but it was a really cute idea that you get to fill out this scan-tron menu of traditional and a little bizarre options that come with a box of incredible looking chips.\n\nThe special (dollar off) frozen margarita was apple so I jumped on that instantly while +1 opted for a mango Jarritos.  We started with the papa bravas to start which were these confit lil' potatoes in garlic red sauce and a bit of cheese in a silver bowl of my new favorite thing.  I was barely done woofing them down when my pollo asado tacos came up.  Spicy but not hot chicken cooled with avocado and white cheese crumbles.  Somehow the best part were the tender (and really sturdy!!) shells. Pretty traditional compared to other options; the +1 played it safe but spicy too getting the al pastor tacos which were gone before I could even see what was in them--caught a glimpse of beef and pineapple. They were a hit with him.  And not to get tacky, but everything was priced well too.  I actually took one of my tacos home (and not just because I filled up on tequila!).\n\nI grabbed a passion fruit margarita before heading out.  Super sweet but just as good as the apple, although not as unique.  Their frozen margaritas, by the way, are perfect.  Nothing syrupy and heavy on the booze.

{"text": "Ambiance:  First thing I noticed when I walked in was the six or so sidewalk bar seats outside facing the restaurant with the kitchen right in the front.  Looked like a great place to sit on a nice day.  Next was the kitchen itself, glassed in and with about 8 people crafting plates.  It was nice to see tortillas being freshly pressed.  The actual dinning room consists of a long line of two person high tables on the left a bar on the right and an upstairs area where some larger booths are located, which can accommodate a group of up to six.  The restaurant is decorated in a Gothic meets modern industrial meets Latin style which was well executed.  Unfortunately it was only about 55 degrees outside and they were running the AC which made the downstairs tables quite chilly.\n\nDrinks: Tried the spicy cucumber marg as well as the anjeo and absinthe one.  Both were well done.  They had a selection of primarily Mexican and Asian beers starting around 4 bucks.  Interesting cocktail list as well and would definitely like to try their sangria at some point.\n\nFood: We started with the Chef's Choice #5 guac which had crab, cojita cheese, and peppers.  It was Amazing!...could seriously eat that every day.  Next we split three orders of tacos, which come with two per order.  I was expecting Mexican style street tacos which can be quite small.  I was wrong.  They were big.  We got the Tako (octupus), Al Pastor, and Korean (short rib).  All were good, but the Al Pastor was the stand out for me.  The pork was cooked perfect as was wonderfully seasoned.  The Korean and Octopus and a little too much sauce for my likely, as it overpowered some of the other flavors.\n\nService: Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, though the service was on the slow side.\n\nTips: Make a reservation a few days in advanced if possible.  I called for a same day reservation for two on a Tuesday and they were booked solid.  Nice spot for a casual yet trendy date.  $20 corkage fee if you'd like to bring your own bottle of wine.\n\nOverall: I will be back at some point to give them another try.

{"text": "The pros: \nOaxaca old fashioned (seriously, try it), reasonably priced Mexican beer, the tacos (especially the Al Pastor pork shoulder and the mushroom), service was great, and enjoyed the ambience (and unique kitchen setup). \n\nWe had an after dinner tequila with their michelada mix (instead of sangrita, which we were told would be on the menu in a week or so), tequila was great, and although it wasn't what we were looking for in a sangrita, the mix was spicy and delicious. We'll probably order a couple of micheladas next time.\n\nThe cons: \nThe \"classic\" guac was a little sweet for my taste and didn't have much kick with jalepenos and pickled habeneros. Probably the only thing I wouldn't consider a value at $8 (the rest of the food definitely was) but they do give you a lot of chips. Tequila prices were a little exorbitant for some of the more common tequilas, but the list was fantastic. Just needs a little better value on the 1.5oz pours on the more run-of-the-mill brands.\n\nThe octopus \"tako\" had very tender and delicious meat, but I wasn't a fan of the toppings. Something was a bit gritty (like sand) that was very distracting. \n\nOur eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs, so I think we have a good sense of how much to order moving forward, but expect a typical bill of around $60-75 depending on how much you're drinking.

The peanuts added a nice crunch but overall, it was an average taco. Another diner ordered the Baja tacos. They were also nothing special as far as fish tacos go. The highlight was the potatoes bravas. They were really flavorful and crispy. Overall, I felt slightly let down.

We ordered the queso and two special taco plates.   One of the specials was shrimp with a bunch of deliciousness including pistachios.  It was a great fresh combo and I definitely wish it was on the regular menu.  The other special was a cheesesteak taco.  This was not your average cheesesteak - tender strips of actual steak - not the processed pressed stuff you think of when you think cheesesteak.   Both specials were absolutely delicious!   Each plate came with two tacos, which was a pretty good portion for the price and quality.   \n\nThe queso appetizer was really the only thing I had a comment about.   The queso itself was awesome.   The soft tortillas it was served with were awesome.  The combo, though, was a little awkward.  Do you make a very cheesy burrito?  Try and dip/scoop with the soft tortilla?  We tried it a bunch of different ways; but in the end, we kind of just wanted some chips to scoop up all that rich and creamy queso.   \n\nService?  Also excellent.  Our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly.   As an added bonus, we asked where the restroom was on the way out.

Although friendly when we spoke both on the phone and in person, she looked like she didn't want to be there at all.

{"text": "Anyone who knows my Yelp reviewing profile knows that it is biased towards hole in the wall restaurants rather than the trendy places that garner all the attention.  Having said that, I occasionally enjoy checking out the latest trendy spots to see if they live up to the hype that they generate.  I'd walked past Tako with curiosity many times before it opened, so when it finally opened for business this summer, I looked for a chance to check it out.  That chance came when I received comped tickets to see The Wedding Singer musical at the Benedum last night.   When I received the tickets three weeks ago, I talked my friend into checking out Tako with me, and she agreed, so I immediately made a reservation.\n\nUpon entering, we had to wait for about two minutes before we being acknowledged, since the hostess was on the phone and had her back to us.  After that amount of time had passed, another woman came over, checked us in, and led us to our table, which was downstairs across from the bar.  The first thing that was immediately apparent to us was how small, dark, and loud the restaurant is--as others have mentioned, it can be challenging to carry on a conversation here.  The tables are so close together that my friend had to squeeze past our neighbors to get to the booth against the wall, and the service was slightly awkward because the waitstaff came uncomfortably close to our table when they were serving the tables on either side of us.  Speaking of service, while our waiter was generally knowledgeable and helpful, I felt that we sat for a bit too long at several points, continuing the theme from when we walked in.  Together, these factors are the reason why I'm not awarding 5 stars.\n\nHaving said that, the food was as amazing as all of the other reviews and my previous experience with Tako's sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes, led me to believe.  My friend and I started off by sharing an order of queso fundido (cheese dip with chorizo and cilantro; $10), which was extremely rich and flavorful to the point that I felt satiated with slightly less than half of the portion (my friend ate the remainder)--something unheard of for me when it comes to cheese.  For entrees, I ordered the mushroom tacos, and my friend ordered the pollo asado tacos ($10 each).  Because the tacos come two to an order, we each traded one taco with one another so that we could each try both of them.  Both tacos were astoundingly complex in flavor and texture--needless to say, these aren't your typical taco stand tacos!  Although both were excellent, my favorite was the mushroom, which had just the right balance of savory, meaty flavor, vegetable notes, and richness from the sauce.  This is clearly 5 star new Mexican cuisine in terms of flavor--and the tacos are well-portioned and priced, to boot!\n\nOverall, my friend and I really enjoyed Tako.  I'll definitely have to make it back to try the tako (octopus) taco, as well as some of the cocktails, both of which looked intriguing.  If you're like me, and prefer a quieter and brighter atmosphere, you may want to try to sit outside if the weather's nice, rather than in the restaurant itself.  4.5 stars.", "user_id": "9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA", "business_id": "diAEN3I9fXcZgNFpA5vz4g", "stars": 4}

As I sat in the small outside bar area, watching the kitchen staff do their thing, I was hoping beyond hope that I would like this place. It was so cute and I love the open kitchen concept.\n\nThankfully, this was by far the best food I had during that trip, and I thought to myself, \"This'll do. This'll do just fine.\"  The tacos were spectacular. Inventive but more importantly full of flavor, and not incredibly expensive for gourmet tacos.\n\nI came back recently and tried some more tacos (I now find that the Korean tacos and the Al Pastor are my favorite so far), BUT a highlight of my night was the tuna belly guacamole (#2 of the chef specials). So so delicious.

{"text": "This place is super trendy/hip, without the arrogance or standoff attitude of most hip places.  Be aware though: This place is super super small, you are basically sitting with your neighbor, very loud music and dark like a club. I think its awesome, but it is certainly something you need to be in the mood for. Don't go there if you are just looking to relax, it def has an upbeat vibe. \nThe service was great! Although it was tiny the manager was able to accommodate our request to sit outside away from the crowd (reservations aren't taken for outside) due to my bf's medical problems. They were super nice and the wait wasn't too long. Service was great through the entire meal. I especially like that everyone was \"hip\" but very nice and down to earth.\nThe drinks were AMAZING. Seriously two of the best cocktails I have every had..high alcohol content (I watched bartender make it), yet it tasted great and not like alcohol too strong. Two margaritas and I had a great buzz going. I recommend the passion fruit margarita, so yummy, and pretty! The spicy cucumber margarita was great too, could actually taste the heat. \nThe food....this place is definitely all about the drinks/vibe, which is fine. The food was really good though, but not the best tacos I have had or anything...they are not \"Mexican\" style in case that is what you are looking for...rather they are very \"clean\" and simple tacos, lots of good options, the pork and pineapple was great!! Lots of fun apps to share, the street corn was really nice.\n\nI def want to go back to try some more margaritas! Loved the place!

{"text": "I think in the case of Tako, a \"Just the facts\" type of review is best.  My s/o and I reserved a table, one month in advance.  Unfortunately, Tako has limited indoor seating.  Upon arrival we noticed that we could have sat at their outdoor counter and eaten,  (Something that we were never made aware).   In retrospect, eating outside would have been so much better because inside was extraordinarily LOUD!!!  Tako has two levels of seating, downstairs is elevated and small tables and the side which is on the aisle is just a stool, no back.  Upstairs it looked like metal tables and equally uncomfortable chairs.  It was a Friday night, so there were lots of people at the bar, which make the noise level even louder.  The strange thing was that they had a DJ playing really, really loud music over some massive speakers which were hanging from the ceiling.  It's dark and loud inside.  I wasn't told that I would be dining at an AC/DC concert.  Waiter took forever to even get to our table, like 10 mins and took our drink order.  A mixed drink is $10, and they have an extensive tequila list but with little explanation as to what is what.  Mix'n match guacamole was just ho-hum and the stuff you can ad is somewhat intriguing but all in all, flavorless.  Drinks were just okay, not very strong or flavorful for the money.  Taco's were good but not great.  The carnitas  was the better of the two we ordered, (the other was beef)  Honestly, for what the ingredients were, there was just a total lack of flavor.  They are good size and you get two tacos per order.  No matter how you dress them up, they're still just tacos and not worth the month long wait.  I'm not a 20 year old but I'm not 50 either and I'm really tired of these new restaurants that are blaring must so loud that I can't hear what the person across from me is saying.  Mediocre food, ho-hum margaritas, lazy waitstaff and ear splitting music is what you can expect if you decide to spend some time at Tako.  Oh, and did I forget they have just one bathroom!

Also ordered the fish tacos which were so good. The fish was nice and crispy, not greasy and lots of flavor in the taco. I do wish they sold their tacos individually instead of 2 per order.

{"text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We had tried to make weekend reservations to T\u00e4ko a couple of times before with no luck.  The attempts were made a couple weeks in advance and while there were times available, they always seemed to be after 9 pm. As a matter of a fact I found the whole calling this place for reservations to be silly as the person on the other end always seemed to be next to a DJ booth.  So while I was in a perfectly quiet environment I was forced to scream to be heard.  Why can't they just use some sort of online system?  I digress though and so my wife and I found ourselves outside of T\u00e4ko at 5 PM as it was opening.  Thankfully we were the last party able to secure a non reservation table and we were led upstairs to the farthest table against the wall.  So while I walked through the whole restaurant I don't know that I saw as much as I should have.  On your way in you can see the kitchen and there are actually a couple of seats outside the restaurant on the sidewalk that act as a \"chefs table\".  They also have some crazy colored bathrooms which I didn't use and then each table seemed to have an odd religious candle on it.\n\nFor dinner my wife and I decided to split the poke for our appetizer which was big eye tuna, seaweed and rice crackers that came with what I thought was a lime crema. I can't say that it was really what I expected as it felt like a play on ceviche.  The tuna was raw but I really enjoyed it whenever I dipped it into the slightly tart lime sauce.  Then for our dinners I went with the duck confit tacos while my wife went with the T\u00e4ko tacos. My tacos came with the duck, cucumber, scallions, pickled peppers, hoisin, cilantro and mint while my wife's consisted of grilled octopus, Harissa aioli, lemons and pickled red onion.  She enjoyed hers immensely and told me that she could eat a whole plate of the grilled octopus that was inside.  My tacos were also pretty good and I loved all the accompaniments to them but I have definitely had better duck confit before.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I look forward to trying more of their delicious tacos and hopefully the next time I am able to procure a reservation.", "user_id": "kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA", "business_id": "diAEN3I9fXcZgNFpA5vz4g", "stars": 4}
{"text": "Great Concept! Great Atmosphere! Great Food! Service can be hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, T\u00e4k\u014d is one of my favorite restaurants and for a lot of other people as well. They problem is, some of the wait staff know that. There's this short little man that works the door and suffers from little man syndrome. You can tell he enjoys telling people that they're all booked up, or some other thing that allows him to go off on a power trip and if you call to make a reservation the rarely answer the phone unless it's to tell you there all booked up. God forbid they offer the next available date that's open. TIP: book your reservation through Yelp so you don't have to deal with the door man or the condescending hostess on the phone. If you can request a section, I would recommend Katie's or Ryan's section. Brandon can be a hit or miss, sometimes he's very friendly and other times he can really throw a world class temper tantrum at your table. If you do get in and you mange to make it past the little man up front, I'd recommend starting off with a drink. The Oxacan Old Fashioned is my favorite but the spicy cucumber is a big hit as well. For apps the Mexican street corn will blow your mind. Always pay attention to the specials menu they give you when seated. The menu changes all the time but by far and away my favorite Taco's have come from this menu.\n\nWhen some new places open up and T\u00e4k\u014d's demand goes down, and the staff turns over a bit, this place will be unbelievable.", "user_id": "3WwssH5SRUP7_KhIpjlz0Q", "business_id": "diAEN3I9fXcZgNFpA5vz4g", "stars": 3}

{"text": "My son and I had tickets to see Idina Menzel in concert. We tried to make reservations but found out to get a descent time you have to schedule two weeks out. I stopped over there when it opened with intent of trying to secure a future reservation and was told they would take us at 6:45. Outside there were tables and bar stools each with a sign advising you to check with the restaurant for those tables.\n\nWhen I met up with my son later on i got a text reminder from the place advising me to confirm or decline my reservation by replying with the appropriate number. The two of us arrived and were seated inside. The place had a vibrant bar scene, was extremely dark, and very noisy.It was also extremely crowded and very hard to read the menu. Directly in front of me was the \"WC\" which I later found out was a unisex bathroom with dark patterned decor.\n\nWe were given tap water to drink along with a pitcher (no ice).Our waiter explained to us that Tako is Japanese for \"octopus\" hence that menu item is named as such. My son wanted to try the duck confit tacos and I settled for the mushroom tacos. The waiter gave us a special menu that we had to read next to some religious candle outlining the specials of the day. He was hungry so we ordered the customized  guacamole with mango and tuna belly. It is served with chips. We received that first and it was outstanding! Some of it was extremely spicy but it made a great appetizer.\n\nOur tacos were served on wooden boards. We each got two. My son liked the duck but thought it was a bit sweet. I liked the mushroom tacos but found them a little bland. So I took some of that guacamole and threw it on top of my tacos  to add that needed zest.\n\nAlthough we were told they had WiFi we were not able to connect to it. We had enough with the chips and tacos so we passed on dessert. My son thought the food was Asian inspired. We received a postcard attached to the check which I thought would serve as a reminder of this place.\n\nMy true rating would have been 3 1/2 stars but I normally round up when I can't decide. One word of advice-They are not open Sun and Mon but you can leave a message if you want to make a reservation. They did call me Mon and advised that normally for weekdays reserve two weeks in advance and for weekends a month in advance. I'm not sure if I would have been seated if I had decided to eat when it opens but I think with the popularity of this place it would be wise to make a reservation.", "user_id": "9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ", "business_id": "diAEN3I9fXcZgNFpA5vz4g", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Reservations were made weeks in advance via Yelp for a Tuesday night dinner. I was bringing in friends from LA, so I was clearly regretting my decision to take them to a taco shop. These were your gourmet tacos, not street tacos, and each taco order comes with 2 tacos- which are pretty huge.\n\nWe started with the Guacamole appetizer- you get a order sheet and check-off the mix-ins that you want. Loved the guacamole, and it came with a lot of chips. The Thrice Cooked Wings were also great- the meat just fell off the bone. The fish sauce taste was distinct, so if you don't like it, don't get it. The wings are given by weight when we asked about how many pieces, and this appetizer was enough for 4 people. \n\nI got the Baja Taco- tempura white fish with cabbage, onion, radish and jalapeno relish. First thought- the fish is huge!! I loved the slaw on top of the fish, but overall, not really digging the taco overall. The fish was not as crispy as I would've liked, and it got a little soggy.

We just got into Pittsburgh after a long 12 hour Amtrak journey from Boston and decided to grab something to eat near our hotel. We came upon T\u00e4ko and were instantly intrigued by the outdoor seating that looked into the kitchen. We waited outside for a few minutes then realized you are supposed to go in and put your name on the waiting list. We spoke to the hostess, who was very nice,and she seated us immediately at the outside counter. \n\nDamien, our waiter, was awesome from the get go. He recommend the Tako taco (grilled octopus) as well as a guacamole blend and a few drinks. In addition to the tako I ordered the Korean taco. The Oaxaca Old fashion was a great Mexican spin on a traditional old fashion and Damien gave us a little background history about how that drink tied into the whiskey rebellion. The tuna guacamole was the perfect fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors. The umami flavors really came through and they were not scant on the amount of the fish they included in it. \n\nThe entrees were also delicious. I highly recommend the grilled octopus taco. The fresh lemon juice and the peanut sauce made for a refreshing and savory coalescence of flavors. The octopus was very tender and the portions were generous. The Korean taco had a good amount of spice it blended the flavors very well. For dessert we had the whipped cheese cake, which was a modern deconstructed version a traditional cheese cake. It spiraled up around a center of blueberries blackberries and raspberries. They topped it off with a creamy vanilla ice cream that stole the show. All of Damien's recommendations were successes.

We also had the Korean and Baja tacos. Both excellent - impressive combinations of flavors. One thing to note - the wagyu on the Korean tacos are deep fried. It was excellent, but I would like to try something grilled in the future as the Baja fish was also deep fried. \n\nWe ordered the Korean buns to start, but this did not agree with our tastes. Stick with the tacos and you'll have an amazing dinner.\n\nThe cocktails are amazingly crafted, well worth the $10 price for quality.

My first experience with the cephalopod, I'd say it tastes like a cross between lobster and shrimp with a similar texture. \n\nMore traditional? Don't miss the carnitas or al pastor tacos or if you'd like to step outside of the box without going all the way to octopus, the Korean tacos are an umami bomb of tender wagyu beef, fermented cucumber, pickled carrots and peanuts. \n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable, sexy even.

{"text": "Having been to, and subsequently fallen in love with chef Richard DeShantz' two other offerings in downtown (i.e. Butcher and the Rye, Meat and Potatoes) AND after waiting two weeks on the waitlist, expectations were no doubt set high for DeShantz' third installment, Tako. Boy, were my expectations exceeded.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE: 5/5\nTucked away between the aforementioned Butcher and the Rye and a corner CVS and across the street from the beautiful Heinz Hall, Tako illuminates the area with a vintage sign proclaiming their offerings: beer, tequila, A/C, and tacos. Directly underneath the sign is a unique sight for downtown, with a street-front kitchen and 5 stools for guests to sit at should they prefer to dine along the bustling 6th ave.\nOnce inside, restaurant-goers will be delighted by the eclectic decor of the place: marquee letter signs spelling out TEQUILA, a giant octopus (t\u00e4k\u014d means octopus in japanese) mural, and a second floor lined with beautiful Spanish railing, all dimly lit by an array of quirky edison bulbs and velvet colored chandeliers. The open kitchen and and impressive tequila bar surround the place and ensure that, no matter where you sit, there's always something to look at. Even if you arrive earlier than the rest of your party, it's nice to simply sit and enjoy the ambiance.\n\nLIBATIONS: 5/5\nAs a big time tequila drinker, I was ecstatic at the site of the large selection of tequilas and mezcals that Tako offers. I ordered a glass of mezcal after the waiter helped me choose one I haven't tried from their unique collection. My girlfriend ordered their 'El Diablo' margarita and it was a perfect mix of sweet and spice. I'll have to come back to try some of their other creative cocktails, the woman at the table next to us told us she was loving her Oaxaca Old Fashioned.\n\nFOOD: 5/5\nWe ordered the obligatory guac & chips to start, opting to build our own with mango, bacon, cotija cheese, sesame and pumpkin seeds. The guac was no doubt delicious, and our ingredient choices were spot on despite some hesitance on our part, since there were so many toppings to choose from. I would have preferred more avocado personally :)\n\nNext was a special of the night, duck quesadillas. It came no sooner than we had finished our guac. Topped with mole and quacking good, these little guys made for a great appetizer.\n\nOnce done with our appetizer, our two taco orders arrived. Served on a giant wooden slab with the restaurant's name etched into it and a gutter in the middle to keep the massive tacos together, the presentation was impeccable. The first taco was the Korean. Very similar in flavor to a Chinese chicken salad (replace the chicken with juicy wagyu of course), sweet savory and a hint of spice. The next taco was the chorizo, which I was less fond of since I have a very very low spice tolerance. The egg on top was a nice, slightly sweet addition. My girlfriend loved both however so those who can handle a bit of heat can't go wrong. \n\nOverall it was a great experience as one would expect from this class of restaurants.

{"text": "Last night was the date of my long-awaited reservation at t\u00e4k\u014d (made nearly a month ago) and it didn't disappoint! My boyfriend and I arrived about five minutes before our 6:30 reservation and were seated by the professional hostess team almost immediately. The kitchen with a small outdoor seating area is in the front of the restaurant, and the inside back area is two stories with moody, eclectic lighting, lots of candles, and murals on the walls. I was glad I was in cute work clothes rather than dressed down, as t\u00e4k\u014d has a trendier fine-dining atmosphere even though the price point is lower.\n\nOur server came over quickly with water and gave us the menus to look over. After a few minutes she came back and explained the specials as well as answered the questions we had. She took our orders without writing them down and made non-awkward eye contact, something you don't encounter so often in restaurants. She ended up being one of the best servers I've had in Pittsburgh...polite, efficient, and just attentive enough without being overbearing. That alone is worth a high rating to me! \n\nThe guacamole that you can customize sounds amazing, so I know we'll be trying it next time. We wanted to get to the main course immediately though, so we both ordered drinks and tacos at once. I ended up getting the red sangria and the al pastor tacos, and Kyle went with Neville Island tea and the carnitas tacos. The sangria was surprisingly incredible and not too sweet...it paired perfectly with my tacos. I had a feeling that the sangria at t\u00e4k\u014d wouldn't be the same glass of mediocrity found at other establishments, and I was correct. The tacos themselves were hands down the best I've ever had. The marinated pork was spicier in this version of al pastor than in others I've experienced, and the chunks of roasted pineapple were generous. The onion was sliced thinly and arranged on top rather than in a chunky heap than ends up falling out of both ends of the taco shell. The avocado salsa was drizzled around the edges, holding the ends together and topping off the flavors and textures perfectly. Not only did this taco taste better than any I can remember having, it was so nicely assembled that eating it wasn't a chore. The assembly and attention to detail is really what makes the tacos here a cut above what some other places have to offer. It felt like fine dining only with super interesting street food, and that's a concept I can get behind. (Kyle came to the same conclusion once he stopped eating long enough to give me his opinion!) \n\nI know we'll return to t\u00e4k\u014d often, and I can see us bringing out of town friends here for a fun night out as well. It's the sort of place that makes me happy to be living in Pittsburgh and proud of what the city's food scene is becoming.

{"text": "I've been dying to actually eat at this place since it opened, so I was pretty excited to finally come for dinner yesterday to celebrate some good food, good friends and another Mini of graduate school come to an end. I was not disappointed.\n\nLet's start with the Food experience: \n\nWe came at prime dinner time with a party of 6. As the place is smaller, filled with two seaters, a lively bar, we were seated upstairs in one of their few booths. I love this. From the top, you get a view of the whole restaurants, where you can watch the people below dine, the food servers scrambling about caring the open faced tacos which sizzle and smell tantalizing. The menu is simple: One half is starters, starting with chips and salsa, and ending poke, chopped and papa bravas [variety ensembles of salads and small bites], the second half is filled with their signature tacos which are serve in sets of 2. On the back of the menu you find an array of signature cocktails made from their wall of tequilas and mezcal. [more on that later]. In addition, there is a daily specials menu highlighting some of their fresh ensembles of the day and a crazy \"build-your-own\" guacamole bar, which my friend J was ALL OVER. \n\nWe ordered the Chips and Salsa as well as the selection of guac that J crafted together as we waited for our drinks. My \"Sookie Stackhouse\", a frozen margarita style drink, garnished with a special set of wax poured FANGS. I enjoy the occasional gimmick like that. It was served with homemade tortilla chips and a generous heaping of cilantro on guac, which, btw, was creamy with some depth in flavor.\n\nI did a split with a friend for the taco. I HAD to try the Tako Taco, for one, as it is the namesake taco, made with Tako's patron spirit animal [Octopus] as the star ingredient, as well as the Mushroom Taco, a veggie taco with Mushrooms and burnt brussels. Floored. By the nth degree, the Mushroom stole the show. A good balance of veggies, paired with oaxaca cheese and garlic aioli. Absolutely fantastic. While the Octopus was done really well, I was upset that it was slightly buried by the accompanying harissa aioli. I personally would have made it more lemony because I love lemony Tako, but as with everything, that's just personal preference. However, it granted me my additional delight of eating a Tako Taco and thereby referencing my favorite youtube video show MPGIS [in this case episode 41]. I chuckle... anyways, moving on.\n\nService was great with a decisive flow to it. Jacen is great, vivacious, and made sure that we were served with good speed and recommendations. Definitely a thrill. Impending service was equally executed. My reservation was completed online and so they called to remind me of my reservation both by email, as well as via phone call and we easily were guided to our seats upon arrival. \n\nNow to my favorite parts of the restaurant:\n\nFirst, the decor. The art around the room is fantastic. For its namesake, Tako, there is a huge Octopus covering the main wall. From the top floor, you look the beast square in the eye, from the lower level, it towers over the patrons, watching them devour tacos or simply waiting itself to devour the patrons, take your pick. On the top wall, you get a view of the last supper. Quite ominous.\n\nSecond, the garage style kitchen. Watch your tacos be made right from the sidewalk view or have them served to you street side . I'm totally interested how they are going to do this in the Winter time. \n\nThird and final, the duality between the restaurants. With the same owners, Tako mirrors and compliments the space of butcher and the rye next door. From the linking walkway between the restaurants, to the opposite placements of the kitchens and the back-to-back bars, it creates split yet intermingled worlds, one in the depths of bourbon and rye, the other a world of tequilas and mezcal. In the end they are all drawn together under the watching eye of the Octopus.\n\nThe experience at Tako is solid, the food is complex and delectable, giving the patrons an opportunity to dive into a dark world for a couple of hours outside the real world. A solid 4.5 stars, which will only be topped once I sit at the bar, stare into the cooking fires making the remaining menu items I left untasted and hear the gentle shaking of ice in making another S.

I enjoyed every type of salsa and the guacamole was very unique. I ordered the Carnitas taco and my bf ordered the Tako (octopus) taco. Loved both although I favored the Carnitas surprisingly.

I would probably be down to try all the taco choices on the menu, to be honest. \n\nI do have to say though, it's kind of weird to have a sit-down dinner wait time for tacos that we all essentially inhaled in a couple minutes.

I loved the outside which looked like a real taqueria, but once we went inside it looked more like a club scene--it was quite dark, cramped, loud, and there was even a DJ spinning.  This might be fun for a club/bar scene, but this is supposed to be a restaurant and they were still serving dinner.  I could barely hear my friend speak or the waiter.  The inside atmosphere was very hipster and a bit pretentious. \n\nWe weren't able to get a dinner reservation until 10pm since they were so busy, so my friend and I had already had drinks elsewhere first.  Since I was driving I decided to order a soda.  Our malebun-wearing pretentious hipster waiter got all offended by this and stormed off without even taking my friend's order.  Another waiter returned 15 min later with my soda and they still didn't ask my friend what she wanted to drink.  It's possible he was also offended because I missed or misunderstood something he said because it was so loud in there.  But this did not get us off to a good start.  \n\nWe had the queso dip which was quite good, though a little pricey, and we needed to get more tortillas to go with it.  The octopus taco (which this placed is named for, as tako means octopus in japanese) was amazing.  The best octopus taco I ever had.  I also had a carne asada taco which felt like it was lacking in some key ingredient and was not that memorable.  The waiter finally spoke to us and became more friendly when he was all excited to explain all the homemade salsas.  Unfortunately none of them were very impressive.  One tasted just like a bbq sauce, not a salsa, and none were very spicy.  Definitely not authentic tasting.  In general, the prices are a bit high compared to other places that have comparable tacos and you don't get any side dishes or anything with your meal.  \n\nI'd go back for the octopus taco but nothing else I thought was really amazing.

While it was good, the blue cheese was a bit strong for the guac, but that's really our fault for selecting it.  I definitely want to try new combinations.  We had a Poke which is raw (sushi) tuna with delicious lime foam on crispy rice crackers.  A couple of the rice crackers had stuck together and were a tad oily, but it didn't detract from the dish.

There is so much to choose from so we went with the regular house guc and added a cheese-well what we thought was queso but their queso was some sort of shredded cheese.

I'm not too sure what vibe they are going for, but indoor seating is definitely not ideal. \n\nAs for the tacos, they are hands down one of the best I've tasted albeit a little pricey.

We were so disappointed by the exceptional hype the city of Pittsburgh has poured in this place that the mood was set after the flavorless Baja taco. \nThe el Diablo did not taste like anything special either except that it was a normal margarita that costs $10. I would have rather dumped $70 on mad mex which has more reliable food am that is worth the money.......Or wish that Yo!Rita was still open......or Verde........or I lived closer to Taco Bell. Our waiter was great though.....\nExtremely disappointed by the hype and how overpriced it is. Also for how annoying it is to make a reservation and how long people wait, the place was 2/3rds full the entire time.", "user_id": "wr7Oc-ZDQK9REIiRUdBVpA", "business_id": "diAEN3I9fXcZgNFpA5vz4g", "stars": 2}

{"text": "So winding out the end of year in Pittsburgh and decided after flying in a little bit early to give Tako a try. I had heard quite a bit of mixed reviews to date and it had been on my bucket list for trying out so glad I was finally able to do so. Since I was in relatively early on a Sunday, there was no wait and there were plenty of seats to be found at the bar. I pulled up a chair as close to the right end of the bar as possible so I could get a glimpse of the chefs preparing the food. The d\u00e9cor is the whole dark/mysterious/casual vibe with the DJ like music playing in the background. \n\nThey provide their menus in newspaper format with a list of separate specials if you desire to peruse. I will admit the prices are a bit steep here for the portion but where else can you get something like this in Pittsburgh. The menu is broken down into multiple small plates and then multiple varieties of tacos. They also have a relatively large selection of adult beverages and the bartenders are pretty knowledgeable even with the standard curve balls of \"surprise me with an awesome drink.\" The tacos are a decent portion and if you do not eat tons, I could see one order of tacos and an appetizer being enough to satisfy the hunger. If you are super hungry then I could see two orders of taco doing the trick. The multia was a special and pretty solid. It came with mole and avocado. All ingredients were blended well together and I loved the freshness of the cilantro and onion sitting on top. It was a solid way to start the meal washed down with their version of an old fashioned. I followed up with waiting for my Korean tacos which came out quickly afterwards on a wooden board branded with the words tako. The tacos were well made and did not skimp on the ingredients. They were packed with flavors including kochujang and loved the cucumbers sliced into it. I would definitely recommend asking for the housemade hot sauce which adds a nice kick to the overall dish. I wrapped up with some lychee drink which was solid but the hummingbird at the end was the solid closer. \n\nAll in all, I thought this place was great and im a fan of what they are doing. Not sure how easy it is to just swing by for a bite but definitely a place I will try to hit back up in the future. The bartenders were also super friendly and very helpful.

I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or \"hello\" to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.\n\nThe tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.

{"text": "This may sound crazy, but Doce Taqueria is the best place to eat in the Southside.  Allow me to explain.\n\nQUALITY:\nFirst and foremost, the food taste and quality is top notch.  Even better, they provide both traditional Mexican style tacos (which is the way to go in my opinion), an Americanized version, and even a revolving vegan option, served on your choice of a flour or corn tortilla.  Because most of us have no idea what the hell half the traditional style Mexican ingredients are, let alone how to combine them in a tasty way, Doce Taqueria took the liberty of creating a simple menu with all the work done for you already.  Just pick 1, or several, and eat away!\n\nPRICE:\nFor the nice quality of food you're getting, Doce Taqueria is very reasonably priced. Tacos are $3, a much better than expected side of black beans is $2, $5 Nachos, and a Mexican or throwback style glass bottle soda from the cooler is $2.\n\nCONVENEINCE:\nDoce is open for lunch until late into the night for some great grub after the bars close.  And when you eat here, don't expect to wait long for your food.  Even when they're busy it's not uncommon to receive your order in under 5min.  \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThere is generally a very small staff of just 1 or 2 people, but everybody I have encountered has been very friendly and inviting.  All the seating is bar style, and the room is adorned with a multitude of decorations that gives it a pleasing southwest yet modern vibe.  Accompanying the decoration there is often Mexican style music (at a reasonable volume) coming over the speakers that helps tie the whole experience together.  \n\nIn conclusion, Doce Taqueria has great food that is served quickly, for a great price, is convenient at many hours of the day (and night), and is a cool little place to chill!", "user_id": "AhxnwK4Y13_s-GVDyALksA", "business_id": "NdUpa6d8zmfgEe7EKxIouw", "stars": 5}

{"text": "I'm so glad Doce Taqueria is in Pittsburgh! This place has all the elements of a perfect little taco shop. There are Mexican bottled sodas, the tacos are absolutely delicious, they offer black beans and nachos to supplement the few taco varieties, and the price is right! You just can't go wrong with that. \n\nMy boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday around 6:30, and it wasn't too busy. We were able to sit and put in orders immediately. It was fun watching the staff assemble our food, and the ingredients all looked and smelled incredible. One note about the service...I thought everyone was incredibly friendly and responsive, however I can see the staff potentially forgetting or not seeing you right away on a particularly busy night. Nothing to keep me from coming back, however I think I would prefer to come when it's less busy since I need my tacos customized due to my dairy allergy.\n\nBetween us we tried the carnitas, chicken, and beef tacos. I inhaled my carnitas and chicken tacos...they were the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. In addition to beef and carnitas tacos Kyle got an order of nachos. I could only look longingly at them since I can't have cheese. He said they were wonderful. I had a Mexican Squirt with my meal and he had an interesting variety of Mountain Dew. We'll both be getting Squirt next time! It was surprisingly refreshing. I'm planning on coming back to Doce Taqueria sooner rather than later.

My resolve apparently did not last long.  \n\nI was hoping to remain anonymous during my time there, but unfortunately it was obvious that I was recognized by the staff almost immediately.  Apparently being the first person to leave a negative review of a 5 star restaurant makes you pretty recognizable.\n\nDuring my time there I was treated very well by the staff and the food was excellent.  When I asked for the check I was told my meal was on the house; an effort to compensate me for my negative experience here.  I tried again to pay for my meal and the staff member was adamant that my payment would not be accepted.

{"text": "Unfortunately I was not impressed with Doce Taqueria. Not sure how they have a 5 star rating, I've had way better tacos from many other places around Pittsburgh. Service was great and their prices are decent so no complaints there. First off their menu is SO small. Only 5 taco choices and only ONE vegan/vegetarian choice. :( I understand having a small menu but only offering 1 vegetarian option alienates a large group of people. Since I'm mostly vegetarian I had to order 2 of the same tacos. Would have been nice to have at least 2 vegetarian taco options and maybe even 1 fish taco option. The veggie tacos weren't bad but extremely plain. I felt they could have been a little more creative with the tacos. I also ordered the nachos. They were not very good. The chips you could tell were an extremely cheap/generic brand same with the melted cheese wiz type cheese. They have the right idea with the toppings on the nachos but need to have better quality chips and cheese. \nWill not bother eating at Doce Taqueria again unless they expand their menu, then I will give them a second try.", "user_id": "bmy45XLtOomcc_EvC-lXRQ", "business_id": "NdUpa6d8zmfgEe7EKxIouw", "stars": 2}

{"text": "Saw this place pop up while browsing Yelp one day for new eats and decided to swing on by. The joint offers five different premade taco options with fixings made to order: carnitas (pork), pollo (chicken), molida (ground beef), Americano, and vegan, along with a side of beans or nachos as additional paid extras for those wanting a little more to their taco fix. Tacos are $3 each and from what I remember of the sides, I think the beans were $2 and the nachos were $5.\n\nI came and ordered four tacos, one carnitas, one pollo, one molida, and one Americano. Also got them with three corn shells and one flour shell. I will say that I definitely liked the corn shells better ... not as starchy as the flour shell and it has a bit more flavor to it. As for which taco was my favorite? Probably the pork one. The pulled pork in it was tender, juicy, and delicious. The slaw and farmer's cheese in it made each bite all the more tasty. I personally found the chicken to be a bit dry ... might do better for them not to overcook it. The beef one was alright ... it might have tasted better with a bit more cheese in it to offset the acidity that comes from the beef and its juices. Overall I found this place to be a great place to get Mexican tacos ... not sure I'd put them above Las Palmas, but definitely a decent option for those around in South Side!", "user_id": "cOrbRK1ZXTGe5_rG5wFOvA", "business_id": "NdUpa6d8zmfgEe7EKxIouw", "stars": 4}

The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing. \n\nI think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good.

The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.\n\nMy boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco.

The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.\n\nWhat's REALLY awesome about this place?

Instead I laid in bed until Pens traffic died down and dragged my roomie out to SouthSide with me to finally try some tacos from this place. And then we got ice cream. And I have no regrets.\n\nThis place is so small you almost miss it, but it is located exactly to the right of Twelve on Carson and is adorable when you get inside.  It's narrow with about 8? barstools lining the counter and maybe two other hightops against the window.  It's decorated in sugar skulls and cool, bright colors and I didn't even mind waiting for my tacos because I was taking in all the d\u00e9cor!\n\nIt was Taco Tuesday, but there weren't too many other people in there, probably because it was the first really cool day of the season (plus the Pens game!).  Even Tia, the bartender at Twelve who also works behind the counter at Doce was very surprised at how dead it was.  Service was quick.  I got one chicken and one carnitas taco and my roomie got a chicken (minus avocado) and Americano.  We inhaled them and they were excellent.  We ended up ordering one more each.  Our bellies were stuffed full and we paid (a whopping 11 dollars each for 3 filling tacos and a bottle of water) and were on our way!\n\nI agree with other reviewers when they say that these tacos are better than Las Palmas.  Doce's ingredients are carefully and perfectly executed and my tacos weren't falling apart in my hand like they ALWAYS do everywhere else in Pittsburgh.  They were so full of flavor and everything worked together so nicely.  I always find myself having to add hot sauce or more salsa or salt and pepper, but here - what they served was spot on.  I really liked this place and I think they are doing an amazing job.  I didn't mind the small menu at all and thought it was a nice thing to have a special of the day where you could get something different.

They have a small vintage fridge filled with sodas. \nThey say the Americano is just like your mom makes. That might be true if your mom is Hispanic. It had seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and cream (sour cream).  The beef was seasoned well and it was a lot of meat for a taco. The shell was soft and all of the flavors melded together. It was one of the best tacos I've had (and I have had many. LOL. The Pollo (chicken) taco had the crumbling Mexican cheese, some avocado, cream along with a lime wedge. The chicken was juicy and the lime juice was perfect. Yum!!\nTacos are $3 each.
